"The tank top is advertised as a long, but is actually normal-to-short in length. It is fine for layering under other clothes, but the material is thin, and the tank is priced a little high for the quality. It is really not recommended for anything but wearing under other clothes.","This is a basic tank that is thin enough to be worn under a variety of tops. It is not long enough to cover past the hips, but it does provide adequate coverage of the chest. The material is thin and the price is high. Overall, this is not recommended."

The quality is good but the material is thin making it good for layering.","This is a basic tank that is thin enough to be worn under a variety of tops.

"Consumers love this camera for its small size (fits in a pocket), ease of use, clarity of the pictures, and the low light feature. The camera has auo presents and some other options.
