"Good place for a dim sum with prices ranging from average to above average (locals get a discount). Attentive and efficient staff, a good place for lunch with great dinner options as well. Service is average in terms of speed. Overall a recommended place.","The dim sum at Pearl Ocean is very good. The dim sum is fresh and delicious. The service is fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable. The ambience is a little sterile and unwelcoming, but that is the case at most dim sum places in the area. The food is good, but the service is slow and the price is high.",0.20754716981132076
"Wait times for food can sometimes be long. The inside cleanliness can be lacking at times. Employees can be unreliable and understaffed. The food is great when finally served after the wait times. Overall, is a good restaurant but quality of service can be rather risky depending on the day.",This place caters to drive-through customers. The inside of the store is clean and comfortable. There are a lot of seating areas and a variety of sandwiches to choose from. The staff is generally friendly and nice. The restrooms are terrible.  The staff are generally nice and take pride in what they do.,0.1923076923076923
"This restaurant is more of a miss than a hit. Customers have complaints of waiting for long periods of time to be recognized, and end up leaving out of frustration. Theres a lot of different menu options, but there seems to be problems with the temperature of the food. It has a nice atmosphere that people enjoy. Seating and taking orders promptly, then getting hot food and proper portions to their customers will make this a nice place to go to.","The food is terrible and the service is terrible. The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is great for families. The food is not very good and the chips are cold. Overall, not recommended.",0.18487394957983191
