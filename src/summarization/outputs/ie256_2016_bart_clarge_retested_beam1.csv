"A little over 1/3 of students had no problems . A handful had issues with chi-squared concepts , and a few struggled with some of the PS questions and degrees of freedom . A couple students did n't understand the study set/quiz answers .",Most students found the chi-square distribution and degrees of freedom as confusing. Some others found the derivation of the chi square distribution and the degrees of degrees of Freedom as confusing.
"Over half of the students enjoyed T-distributions , and a third liked F-distributions . A few students did n't enjoy anything , and one student each liked comparing variances and sampling distributions .","Most students had trouble with the distribution, especially the T and F distributions. Some students had problems with the t distribution, and the examples used to illustrate it."
"Almost 40 % of students found nothing to be difficult . A handful struggled with lognormal distribution and PS/study set questions -LRB- and their irrelevance , in particular -RRB- . A few students had trouble with one-sided intervals and confidence intervals .",Most students found the confidence interval and hypothesis testing interesting. Some others found the lognormal distribution and the study set questions as interesting. A few students found one-sided intervals and the one-side interval problem as confusing.
"Around one fourth of students found hypothesis testing on Population Variance such as pooled variance mostly interesting . Another 19 % of students were interested in Type 2 Error , and 16 % of students were interested in T Value , T test and T distribution . Several students also found Paired Observation interesting .","Most students found paired observations and type 2 error interesting. Some others found pool variance, hypothesis testing, and the use of the t distribution interesting."
"About half of students found nothing confusing . A handful still had trouble with mean square error , as well as concepts related to bias -LRB- and unbiased -RRB- . A couple students needed clarification on the project , as well as specific differences in the graphical representation/reliability of mean square vs. bias .","Most students had no problems with this lecture. Some students had trouble with the Mean Square Error equation, the bias formula, or the homework assignment. Some others had trouble understanding the sampling distribution, and the point of estimate."
"Over a third of students had no problems ; however , another third seemed lost with the last question relating to mean , median , and mode . A small handful did n't understand variance and standard deviation , and a couple students struggled with statistics and probability , as well as r-programming .","Most students found nothing challenging. Some students had trouble with the last example, the relation between mean and median, and the last graphic that explained the separation of the mode and mean. Some others had trouble understanding the difference between mean, median and mode, and finding variance."
"Over half of students had no trouble with the concepts . A handful had issues with mean square error and some of the PS questions . A few are experiencing confusion with bias , and a couple with various estimations .","Most students had problems with the ps, especially the mean square error question. Some students had trouble with bias and the sample estimation question. A few students had no problems."
"Almost half of students said they enjoyed hypothesis testing . About a quarter liked confidence intervals , and a handful liked confidence intervals for variance or variance intervals . A few students indicated H0 and H1 as their favorites , and a couple pointed out liking the examples .","Most students found hypothesis testing and confidence intervals interesting. Some others liked the concept of H0 and H1, hypothesis testing in general, and the confidence interval."
