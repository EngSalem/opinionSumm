This 100 pack of DVDs contains many high quality DVDs although some DVDs may be unusable or low quality. The DVDs are not actually gold, they are silver. The pack is recommended if large quantities of DVDs are needed on a usual basis. Otherwise, a smaller pack may be more suitable.
Unlike the description of gold-colored discs, these HP DVD+R discs are actually silver in color, probably because HP stopped producing the gold-color discs. The reliability of HP DVD+R discs is generally high, but may be hit-or-miss with these discs specifically. Despite the caveats, these discs are generally recommended.
These DVDs are good quality from a reliable brand. However, they are the silver coated, not gold coated version. The packs may contain some coasters or an occasion disc which won't play. For casual burners this can be negated by the large number of DVDs available in each pack.","
Produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on DVD players. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. The box is too big and allows the spindle to bounce around in it.
Vendor describes the product as being gold in color, which is not the case. It is silver coated and has the same id as other HP branded products.

The tablets provide a good pump when they actually decide to stay tablets. They tend to seemingly break apart in the container, just leaving powder behind. It is at a great price, at least.
These are great for many things including libido and workouts. One downfall of these are they they are difficult to take anywhere because the tablets are a bit loose and turn to powder making them tough to take.
These pills work extremely well when it comes to vascularity and energy. Just make sure to store them in the container they come in, otherwise there is a chance they could start to disintegrate. Overall, the quality appears to be excellent and on par with other brands.","
This is a high quality supplement that is high quality. The capsules must be kept in the original container with the drying agent and should be stored in the same way as the box. They will turn powdery when not in the container and will blow up if not. Some tablets blow up after use, which burns the tongue. Not sure if it helps with libido or desire issues.
This supplement has a short shelf-life and tends to disintegrate into a powder"

a good product, compares to the original very good, for the fraction of the size. very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm, since the space is an issue there. there was no power cord, so that should be kept in mind. much better than nose generating apps.
This sound machine is a great size for traveling and it runs on batteries. It's made to provide a pleasant atmosphere for sleep, not to drown out loud noises. It only has one sound effect available, rain water, which can be adjusted to go up or down in volume. Overall, it's a good product for creating quieter sounds. However, it's lack of options and low sound intensity makes it a bit overpriced.
This Marpac sound machine is compact and sized for travel. It is rather limited in how the sound can be adjusted, but overall the sound itself fills the room and generally drowns out background noise.

These hooks are decent for hanging up very small things. Common household essentials such as oven mittens or kitchen towels are possible to hang up, but give a hassle with the hook sliding down. The magnets attach to the hooks are too small to handle many things, but are pretty strong for it's size.
These magnets come up short when it comes to delivering promises. The size of the magnets are fairly large but the magnets tend to be far too weak to actually hold anything up.

The tiny magnets look good as refrigerator decorations but are not recommended to purchase for use as a strong magnet.","

This solar charger works well at first and charges phones well but does not adequately charge iPads or Kindles. The LED flashlight is quite bright. Performance over time is not reliable as the charge battery begins to not hold charge. A battery charge level indicator would be helpful. Overall, a decent purchase for a backup or travel.

This is a comfortable to wear tank, however, it runs small and the material feels a bit thin.  The length is actually average and not long, or tunic length as described.  Washes well, but expect a bit of shrinkage.  Overall, underwhelming and a tad overpriced for the quality of the garment received.
The tank top is advertised as a long, but is actually normal-to-short in length. It is fine for layering under other clothes, but the material is thin, and the tank is priced a little high for the quality. It is really not recommended for anything but wearing under other clothes.
