This 100 pack of DVDs contains many high quality DVDs although some DVDs may be unusable or low quality. The DVDs are not actually gold, they are silver. The pack is recommended if large quantities of DVDs are needed on a usual basis. Otherwise, a smaller pack may be more suitable.
Unlike the description of gold-colored discs, these HP DVD+R discs are actually silver in color, probably because HP stopped producing the gold-color discs. The reliability of HP DVD+R discs is generally high, but may be hit-or-miss with these discs specifically. Despite the caveats, these discs are generally recommended.
These DVDs are good quality from a reliable brand. However, they are the silver coated, not gold coated version. The packs may contain some coasters or an occasion disc which won't play. For casual burners this can be negated by the large number of DVDs available in each pack.","
This DVD + R media is not gold coated. It is silver coated and will not play on DVD players. The packaging is too big and allows the spindle to bounce around in the box. Overall, not worth the money.

The tablets provide a good pump when they actually decide to stay tablets. They tend to seemingly break apart in the container, just leaving powder behind. It is at a great price, at least.

This sound machine is a great size for traveling and it runs on batteries. It's made to provide a pleasant atmosphere for sleep, not to drown out loud noises. It only has one sound effect available, rain water, which can be adjusted to go up or down in volume. Overall, it's a good product for creating quieter sounds. However, it's lack of options and low sound intensity makes it a bit overpriced.
