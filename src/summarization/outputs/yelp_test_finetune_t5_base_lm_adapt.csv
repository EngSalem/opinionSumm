"This is trendy, upscale Chinese restaurant that sometimes hits a home run of food, but often misses the target when it comes to service. It's in a great location, clean, comfortable, and attractive on the inside.

"This location is frustrating to deal with and rarely has pizzas hot and read between 4 - 8 pm, as advertised. They have very poor customer service and it's difficult to get through on the phone at times. Sometimes, the pizzas don't taste great, needing more sauce and cheese. Overall, not recommended.","I have never been there when they have pizza actually ready for customers that are there. They are always behind, and they have very poor customer service skills. I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He / she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape."
This Little Caesars has a big problem with making pizza on time. Wait times on average 15 minutes after placing an order. Calling ahead of time is fruitless as the phone doesn't get answered. The employees don't care and can be rude. Pizza isn't poor and not worth it. Very poor management has led to poor customer service.,"I have never been there when they have pizza actually ready for customers that are there.

"The food here is served fast and fresh, but it is a little expensive for a small joint like this. However, the portions are large. Some dishes taste a little bland and dry, like the chicken fries and carnitas torta. The service is friendly, but the atmosphere can be loud with the TV.","The food was good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. I became an instant Rivas fan after trying what I think is the best chicken burrito in town. Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well. Goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. Three stars because the food was edible."

"This place has a salsa bar that features a wide variety of different salsas that are very good, and also features a very good guacamole.  They have a variety of tacos, featuring different meats, that are recommended. The rice isn't very good and prices are a bit high for what you get. Overall this place is recommended.","It's a nice place to hang out in the summer. The food is good, but the service is a little underwhelming. I would recommend this place if you're looking to get away from Chipotle or Taco Bell. I have eaten at Fresco three times. The first two times I didn't have any complaints about the food. The tacos are really good. The last time I ordered take out, the chicken was slightly over"

"The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender.
