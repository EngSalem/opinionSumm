"There was no confusing topic It was somewht confusing seeing the xbar and its distributions Nothing the relation between x-bar , xi and their calculations Everything was understandable None i didnt find anything confusing No such a point properties of mean and median were a bit hard to understand This was a clear lesson and the lecturer asked whether there was anything we did n't understand . The fact that when students ask questions in Turkish , the lecturer does n't repeat the question in English anymore -LRB- which he used to do before -RRB- . It is very hard for non-Turkish speaking people to understand the answer if the question is not clear . Sampling distribution of mean Nothing finding mean And medians of different kinds of graphication styles are confusing nothing for this class Why do we need the distribution of the mean ? Without knowing the distribution of the mean , can we not calculate ? scatter plot Normal distribution histogram and cdf graphs interaction between statistics and sample distributions X-bar distribution Sample selection with intersection describing distribution of the sample about graphics we used Enough information Relation between different samples İt will be better if solid examples with numbers is given for graphical techiques empirical and normal distribution were different . It was difficult to understand but i understood the difference thanks to repeatations of the instructor .

"It was quite interesting that we can compare distributions by the help of Q-Q plot . In addition , X-bar 's being q distribution itself seems a little bit weird yet it will be useful The topics are starting to get complicated . It was interesting to see the new topics comparing samles and distributions in q q plot the difference between q-q plot and normal distribution plot Explanation of the relation between the histogram and scatterplot diagrams seeing cdf and frequency graphs together was interesting according to histograms , we can plot the empirical mean and theoretical mean and medians R coding comparimg normal distribution and samole distributions were mostly interesting The concept of Q-Q plot was interesting . Simulation example Q-q pilot sampling distribution i think sampling of distributions is kind of interesting and useful for us the topic of simulation was interesting How are the plots drawn with different distributions graphical illustrations Q-Q plot the point sample is a distribution Empirical median scatter plot the properties of sample sanpling distribution Usage of statistics in human life Scatter plot and empirical mean Simulation example The relation between median and mean . When Distribution is n't normal , median and mean are different . It was boring compared to the previous one interpretation of the sampling graphs I found Q-Q plot most interesting since it compares two distributions without needing 3th dimension . graphical representation of difference between mean and median i understand completely the meaning of sampling distribution of mean . Empirical median - theoretical mean and median from the histogram Q-Q plot very good to repeat every confusing thing Difference between sample mean and normal mean I think that class was not very interesting because we were already familiar with most of the concepts . the graphics are the most useful thing in the course . we can use a lot them in the real life Learning that x bar is a Random variate was the most interesting part for me the difference between the median of normal distribution and empirical median the part explaining empirical vs theoretical distribution . bank queue simulation problem relating with statistics . normal probability plot Comparing emprical data and normal distribution guessing mean and median from a histogram by intuition the first part Q-Q plot of today 's course was more interesting than the rest .

It seems like a high probability . the all R topics like rasterimage and i think that R should be covered more properly in class . t distribution the problem session . its the most useless part of the class , with the instructor going too fast , not explaining things clearly and just doing whatever she wants . and she doesnt even upload the solution to moodle I did not quite understand the teta thing . It is really confusing for me point estimate Difference between capital and small X it 's not about the lecture but i still find homework very difficult and confusing . parameters of guality on observor when calculating mean of the population dont knowing mean but guessing what is The least probability that WE can say The Event is probable Point estimate topic was a little bit abstract but I think we will elaborate on that in the next class I do n't quite understand point estimates , though I know we will go over it again on Friday . @extractive",Many students had trouble understanding the point estimation .

The decision of what probability implies conclusive result is confusing as it is linked to the hypotheses testing the comments we make after we find probabilities were a bit difficult Ps there may be another sol . for the questions Directions of inequalities while computing probabilities Lognormal Lognormal The 4th question in the study set wasnt answered clearly F distribution was a little confusing but I got it later Commenting about edtimation kind of wuestions Nothing Ps Deciding whether two variances are equal for given sample variances and sample sizes was confusing . F distribution using table Nothing there are few errors in the study set . teaching assistant should be more careful while she preparing our most important source of studying nothing equality in f dist F dist deciding on critical value and conclusive interval were hard for me Good 30th question . I had difficulty to understand the solution . Central Limit Theorem f distribution F distribution questions Calculation of deciding whether a given population parameter is true or not . exam will be confusing Unclear questions boxplot-outliers Nothing Finding interval for probabilities it was very was easy and clear Exam ps questions plotting of the normal quantile quantile plot Nothing Exact solutions were n't given from the table slightly confusing day since ghe subjects are not new the ps was satisfying :-RRB- maybe checking the accuracy of solutions before lecture would be better for ps Nothing The problems that are solved may be clarified more None @extractive,"In this lecture students were confused by lognormal problems , what the comment after finding the probability of something , f distributions , and deciding upon accuracy of population parameters .

"last two ps questions could not be solved as the time expired it was a smooth lecture could n't last questions in ps The r experience was a bit Fast and hard to follow and the ps TA made simple questions look like a bit more complicated R vectors It would be better if we have the question sheet in the 2nd hour I couldnt understand the R completely . I mean probably I can not find the solutions of other problems İn r function there can be more examples If questions are answered in Turkish , they should be repeated and answered in English and not just answered in Turkish ! It is impossible for exchange students to follow otherwise ! Creating data Second question if the confusions about problems in the ps and left problems will be solved before the quiz it would be useful enough because of time restrictions inferring informations from histograph is a little confusing since it is new for me None Other questions which werenot solved There are 2questions left from the second ps , those must be answered . Rstudio ps was not good I could n't concentrate much reading plots in R Students are forced to be too passive in sessions I can not benefit from R lessons . Class is not optimal for such education , we are too crowded . I try to learn it myself . Ps assistant could n't manage her time properly . r studio Teaching Assistant was teaching fast . It was difficult for me to follow her . Problems related to median and mean How to use r question 3 in ps 1 was confusing At ps hours , because of solving problems rapidly , i did not catch the calculations of medians . we can not solve the last two questions of ps if we can solve them before quiz it will be very good the importance of R must be explained firstly 100 days-gallon problem the last two questions of ps Wifi connection is very low in our class . Therefore , we couldnt download R in class . smallest-largest mean for me it was the 2nd question part c was a little bit confusing we couldnt solve the last 2 ps questions , and they were more relevant with the course rather than first ones . We should start to use R ourselves . we can plot normal dist when the values are not continous but for it to work we need a lot independent variables , but like how much ? in the question it was 100 to Compare return why do WE use geometric mean The R session was confusing that the comments and their usages were not clear enough Still not very clear how to use R/what data we were using at all times today when we were discussing R @extractive","Students had trouble knowing when to use R , and would have liked more examples .

"it was a smoooth class nothing nothing the change in the direction of inequalities confused me . the probabilities on both sides of the chi squared distribution equaling a/2 was a bit confusing F distribution projection The use of the F distribution -LRB- why it is sigma-2-square * S-1-square / -LRB- sigma-1-square * S-2-square -RRB- and not sigma-2-square * S-2-square / -LRB- sigma-1-square * S-1-square -RRB- -RRB- none for now determining the dofs of F Interval estimating Everything is clear Standard error Nothing Nothing at all variance interval confidence interval on proportion of the variances of two populations .
