They also enjoyed understanding the relationships between different distributions, including the distribution of samples."
"Students were mostly confused about F Distribution , Problem session and quiz questions . Some also had trouble with T Distribution , Confidence Interval and Alfa Value , while 27 % of students found everything is clear .","In this lecture students had trouble with the F distribution, T and F distributions, Confidence intervals, and the 4th question in the ps. Students also had trouble understanding the tableau of F distributions."
"The majority of students found Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Interval of Variance mostly interesting , including one-sided interval , two-sided interval and application . Several students also were interested in H0 & H1 parameters , Chi Distribution","In this lecture students enjoyed learning about hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and one-sided intervals. They also enjoyed using H0 and H1 parameters to determine the confidence interval."
"A little over 1/3 of students had no problems . A handful had issues with chi-squared concepts , and a few struggled with some of the PS questions and degrees of freedom . A couple students did n't understand the study set/quiz answers .","In this lecture students had trouble with chi-square distribution, degrees of freedom, and greyscale intensity. Students had no problems with the PS question4."
"Over half of the students enjoyed T-distributions , and a third liked F-distributions . A few students did n't enjoy anything , and one student each liked comparing variances and sampling distributions .","In this lecture students mostly had trouble with T and F distributions. They also had problems with the distribution of fat content, reading the table, and understanding the relationships between distributions."
"Almost 40 % of students found nothing to be difficult . A handful struggled with lognormal distribution and PS/study set questions -LRB- and their irrelevance , in particular -RRB- . A few students had trouble with one-sided intervals and confidence intervals .",Most students found the topic of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to be the most interesting. Some others found the lognormal distribution and the study set questions as interesting. A few students found one-sided intervals and the confidence interval as confusing.
"Around one fourth of students found hypothesis testing on Population Variance such as pooled variance mostly interesting . Another 19 % of students were interested in Type 2 Error , and 16 % of students were interested in T Value , T test and T distribution . Several students also found Paired Observation interesting .","In this lecture students were interested in paired observations, type 2 error, pooled variance, hypothesis testing based on sample variances, and the difference of the mean values."
"About half of students found nothing confusing . A handful still had trouble with mean square error , as well as concepts related to bias -LRB- and unbiased -RRB- . A couple students needed clarification on the project , as well as specific differences in the graphical representation/reliability of mean square vs. bias .","In this lecture students had trouble with the mean square error equation, the sampling distribution, and the bias formula. They also had trouble understanding the homework assignments."
"Over a third of students had no problems ; however , another third seemed lost with the last question relating to mean , median , and mode . A small handful did n't understand variance and standard deviation , and a couple students struggled with statistics and probability , as well as r-programming .","Most students found nothing challenging in this lecture. Some students had trouble with the last part of the lecture, understanding the relation between mean and median, and understanding the difference between the means and means of different distributions. A few students had problems with the histograms, and the last example."
"Over half of students had no trouble with the concepts . A handful had issues with mean square error and some of the PS questions . A few are experiencing confusion with bias , and a couple with various estimations .","In this lecture students had trouble with mean square error, bias, and the sixth question in the exam. They also had problems with the sample estimation and confidential interval variance."
"Almost half of students said they enjoyed hypothesis testing . About a quarter liked confidence intervals , and a handful liked confidence intervals for variance or variance intervals . A few students indicated H0 and H1 as their favorites , and a couple pointed out liking the examples .","In this lecture students enjoyed learning about hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and one-sided intervals. They also enjoyed using H0 and H1 parameters to determine the confidence interval."
