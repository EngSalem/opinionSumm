A few students didn't understand the last part of the lecture, and a few others had problems with T-theory, the questions asked by other students, or nothing at all."
"Most students found type 2 errors interesting . A minority -LRB- of 2-4 each -RRB- found type 1 errors , confidence intervals , beta number , and p value interesting .","Most of the students found Type 2 Error mostly interesting. Some other students were interested in different ways of testing Hypothesis, P value, Confidence Interval and power of the test. A few students also found Type 1 Error, Cheat sheet and beta number interesting."
"In this lesson students had trouble with type 1 error , the question went over that was on the exam , deciding to reject H0 or not , applications of hypothesis testing , and the playing cards example . Students would have liked more examples of going through the problems so they could understand the process better .","Most of the students found H0 and H1, Type 1 Error, Application of Hypothesis Testing and Probability of Making A Mistake as confusing. Some of them need more examples to understand hypothesis testing, and some need to know when to reject H0 or H1."
"There were two fundamental issues with the class . One , the students felt rushed and were unable to complete the required exercises , and two , the teaching assistant was seen as disorganized and rushed .","Most of the students couldn't solve the last 2 questions of the ps session, and a few struggled with R, the R session, or nothing at all. Some students found the use of R and creating plots in general to be the most challenging part of class."
"In this lecture students were confused by lognormal problems , what the comment after finding the probability of something , f distributions , and deciding upon accuracy of population parameters . Students had trouble understanding the answers to the practice problems .","Most of students struggled with F Distribution questions, finding intervals for probabilities, understanding the problems that are solved, and determining whether two variances are equal. Some students also struggled with Lognormal Questions, Plotting of normal quantile quantile plots, and Central Limit Theorem."
"Students had trouble knowing when to use R , and would have liked more examples . Some students had trouble using Rstudio . They were also concerned about the questions in the practice session , as they did not get to go over them .","Most of the students couldn't solve the last 2 questions of the ps session, and a few struggled with R, the R session, or nothing at all. Some students found the use of R and creating plots in general to be the most challenging part of class."
"In this lecture students really only had problems with F distributions . There were a few students with problems such as intervals and standard error , but most students either had no problems or trouble with F distributions .","60 % of students found everything clear. The rest of students had some trouble with the F distribution, variance intervals, degrees of freedom, and the use of S-1-square and S-2-square in estimation."
"In this lecture students were mainly interested by paired observations and pooled variance . They also liked dealing with dependence , unequal variances , and using the t-distribution in new ways .","Most of the students found pooled variance, paired observations, and pooled variance as interesting. Some of them also found differences between first and second mnumbers, difference disy distribution, and dependency interesting."
