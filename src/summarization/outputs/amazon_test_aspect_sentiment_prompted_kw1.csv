It has a good low light feature which can be helpful in areas where flash is not allowed. The camera has a variety of options and can be used to adjust the settings to allow for a more professional look. It's a good value for the size and the price. However, an SD card is not included which can cause problems with the camera's performance. Overall, it is not recommended."
