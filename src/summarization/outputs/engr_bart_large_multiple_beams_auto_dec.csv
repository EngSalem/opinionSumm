"The interaction of the matrix and vectors Matrix manipulation How complex some of the coding seems to be yet it has an easy solution . The only reason it seems problematic is that you have to code everything correctly . the partner programming was really helpful I found that being able to work with others on coding is very interesting . I would n't expect to do that with something like coding . New commands for matlab functions Manipulating the matrix to change the values after creating a generic matrix of tens was the most interesting part today . Paired programming because I had never done it before and it was more enjoyable that programming alone . finding that their is a function that I can use to flip arrays . Today 's class was challenging for me . We had some coding assignments with time limits . It was nice working in pairs and I am looking forward to it . learning to code in pairs Learning how to manipulate matrices with other vectors . Learning more about MATLAB and learning new people . coding with a partner Experiencing paired programming in class and being navigator and the driver It was interesting to work in a group to see the thoughts of the other person and it was great that you explained how to change specific rows and columns of the matrix . Getting to work with someone and discuss our thought process and work through problems The thing I found most interesting is the teamwork required for paired programming . Completing matrix calculations while conversing with a partner was difficult yet quite interesting . I found the transpose function pretty interesting . Coding in MATLAB with pairs was much more interesting than coding alone . It was a good way to share knowledge and support each other . Also , I really liked the driver-navigator roles since we can easily catch the errors of each other . Program pairing was interesting as well as helpful Pair programming The uses of MATLAB to change lines of a matrix Driving and navigating through code . Paired programming was more fun than coding by ourselves because we had a partner to bounce ideas off of . The challenges in coding . they 're not easily tackle and needed help . I think using referencing to change values of certain parts of the large matrix was interesing because even though it was n't extremely helpful , I saw how it could be potentially helpful in a larger scale I thought the functions we used were interesting Paired programming how to manipulate matrices and extracting certain portions of data to use later The most interesting part of today 's class is the exercise where my partner and I switched off being the driver and navigator . Paired partnering was a new and interesting way of completing an assignment . Paired programming Working with a partner Working with a partner was the most interesting part of the class . The paired programming exercise The most interesting thing about class was the matrix manipulation . paired programming is a very effective learning tool for me . I enjoyed working with josh a lot . Paired Programming i enjoyed working with others to overcone programmig obstacles learning/improving how to use Matlab and more of its commands . I found working with a partner and finding out how they worked differently when coding . Paired programming made it much easier for us to program because two people makes it better than 1 I thonught it was interesting how two people could work together on a single script on a single computer I think I enjoyed working with a partner more than anything and it was interesting that we got multiple perspectives . I found paired programming particularly interesting as I learned how to work on MATLAB as well as navigate my partner through MATLAB . It helped in further developing my interest as well as understanding in different MATLAB functions . Working in pairs , and having an idea of a `` driver '' while someone describes the code that needs written Learning more and more about matlab because I know nothing about it I found most interesting was the partner work . my partner and I had similar backgrounds in coding so it made it easy to communicate . Working as a team to complete goals together The experience of coding in teams of two . Working on the problem together made it go more quickly and we were able to bounce ideas off of each other , so I learned different methods of working on the problem from my partner . I found the matrix indexing the most interesting Working with another student to figure out solutions . Matrix referencing and paired programming . I found the new coding language we learned today the most interesting . Matrix manipulation using the bracket operators was the most interesting part Working with pair Being able to utilize pair programming in order to get feedback on my MATLAB coding and get help when needed . I found how it 's row then column strange because it seems backwards to me using the ones function I thought that learning new shortcuts to work faster in matlab was interesting What I found most interesting in today 's lecture was the ability to replace certain rows and columns within a matrix . I feel like this could be very useful for applications in the future . The pair programming is much fun and interesting than the individual programming . I liked working with someone while programming How to pair program effectively and work with another programmer Working with partners to complete the code and script for the problem Working in a team while coding helped clear some problems I had using matrix functions Working on a paired programming assignment and seeing how other people think about code . Working with a partner Matrix Manipulations was interesting Pairing up with partners was also fun I thought that matrix manipulation was very useful and it taught me how to certain parts of arrays without hard coding the digits in It was very interesting to figure out how to come up manipulate coding to work with matrices . It was challenging but also interesting . paired programming is Matrix indexing and manipulation requires great depth of knowledge about matrix functions and commands . The most interesting this in the class was learning new commands in MATLAB and using them on it . coding about matrix manipulations is the most fun part I think Coding with a partner . Being able to work as a team to tackle coding problems . This showed the importance of communication and cooperation . pair study The paired programming was most interesting It was great learning how to manipulate matrices . Also , paired programming is helpful and interesting . Learning how to manipulate matrices in MATlab Working with someone new and realizing I 'm not quite as behind in the class as I had previously feared in terms of coding/Matlab Paired programming is fun . I meet new guys and we share our ideas . Learning how to work with vector and matrix manipulation in MATLAB . When we worked in partners I got help for understanding what specific commands mean and it will help me on future assignments Working in pairs works well Learning new matlab techniques This was a very interesting class especially when we learned new functions like sum and ones and different coding like that . I also think I go better at doing vectors and remembering to comment . It was very interesting working with the Cat function to combine matrix together and see the compiled data I enjoyed my first experience with paired programming . It was far more enjoyable than programming alone Paired programming was interesting as it showed how much more efficient I could be while working with a partner and not having to both read directions and code at the same time . Finding ways to create the matrix I enjoyed working with a partner . It was nice to bounce ideas off someone else & have someone to vent your frustration while going through the process Learning how to better manipulate matrices . I found most interesting that Matrix manipulation can allow you to analyze matrices like none other . I found Professor Hynes ' and Andres ' detailed demonstration very interesting . I was able to learn several tips ans tricks about MATLAB and now I feel better prepared for the class 's problem sets and homework . Hopefully the professor can demonstrate more things in the future so that I can learn more about MATLAB and other parts of this class . I also found the pair programming to be a fun and productive excercise in teamwork and communication . It was a fun and helpful excercise . I am wondering when we will do it again . Paired programming was a great way to work collaboratively on coding , which made the process much more efficient and enjoyable . It was interesting how two people can work together and individually contribute in paired programming . It was fun working with new people and seeing how we each communicate . Paired programming was awesome and a lot more productive Trying to find and create code with the parameters that we were given . It was much easier and more fun working with a peer . Also I found many of my mistakes which were not that obvious to me as they would be for others . In today 's class I really enjoyed working with a partner . It definitely helped me to better understand MatLab and what was going on . @extractive","A majority of the students said that they found paired programming to be the most interesting part of this lecture .

Nothing was confusing , just need more practice to get good at writing fluently in the matlab language The print statement was rhe most confusing part of the lecture . I did n't know which commands or functions I needed to use and some times I felt like my approach was too basic although it solved the problems . at first I found selecting a specific area in a array to be difficult but I think I understand it now .

Replacing elements of a matrix with arrays and columns in multiple commands . -LRB- Problem 1 , section 7 -RRB- How to complete the Concatenation section of problem 1 . The solution to the complex matrix problem on the board was very confusing . I 'm still confused in the syntax . Some of the questions were unclear . for example it would say the vector counted up from 7 to 10 . Publishing code for script files It was confusing to know if they wanted us to hardcode or not in certain examples . This could be better specified in the answer sheet . The use of the sum functions with arrays is hard to understand Even with the help function , it was not clear how to use the sum and ones functions . My partner and I were initially confused with the use of brackets in the sum function . Array indexing is still quite hard to code . I still have problems with the syntax when indexing . Getting used to the Matlab is a confusing process for me . Some of the questions in the problem sets like the replacing matrix , I think there is an easier code to approach but I could not get a hand on it Sum of the three values was confusing Course standards and expectations The word `` concatenation '' . We got confused using the `` sum '' function . when replacing elements in a vector We did n't end up figuring out the sum command and it wasted about 20 minutes that I think would have been useful if you had explained it more . It was a bit confusing to figure out exactly what we needed to input to get sum functions to work Ones Most of my calculations were mostly guesses and I did n't understand how to manipulate arrays before hand . I had to research separately to find out what to do Some matrix operations were confusing . Especially creating the vector X . It is hard to replace the parts of the vector with other vector without it taking tons of steps . Concatenation The sum functions When we would be getting our teams . I still do n't know when that will begin . The use of certain matlab commands that we had to use today . For example , the sum command . The most confusing thing was the transform the visual matrix into code . How to perform certain operations was confusing to me , but working as a pair helped me a lot . The level/intensity of codes some of the details as far as who we had to work with and what we could and couldnt do as partners was confusing We were having problems in the ` copy vectors ' so we asked and peer teacher and he was unable to help us . we managed to get the answer by ourselves . It was very confusing when trying to figure out how to use the ones function but after it was figured out it was much easier . It was hard to start the project because we could not figure the ones command in Matlab Some of the wording on ps02 specifically on the vector creation was kind of weird . I 'm not sure what the term concatenation means , but I think we 'll be able to figure it out . Some of the matrix manipulation functions are particularly confusing , especially the functions `` ones '' and `` sum '' . How to create a sum of matrix parts , since this sometimes was confusing to do Matlab in general . I 've had no experience coding before so being thrown into it kinda sucks . Wish they would 've given background info how coding works nothing was confusing thant needed detail per se . the confusement came from trying to find different ways to complete the assignment still following the set parameters . When to use the sum function . Not much Trying to replace multiple rows and columns was confusing , because we were not sure where our errors came from , nor why they were occurring . Some of the functions were a little difficult to figure out how to use Figuring out the sum function even though it had very little information in Matlab about it . I was n't sure if we were allowed to share the file we worked together on or if we each had to do it at some point . When you do n't have any coding experience and it asks you to do a command you have never seen or heard of . Using brackets to manipulate nonconsecutive columns and rows pf a matrix at the same time Use of arrays Some of the instructions in the document neemed unclear at first , but were okay in the end . I was very confused as to how to input the code for changing the inside of a matrix how to use the sum function . It was explained poorly Figuring out how to use array indexing to get the values adjacent to a certain value What was slightly confusing was trying to replace multiple rows at the same time . We learned that you have to have separate lines of code for each replacement of a row or column in a matrix with a vector . Overall , this does n't appear like it will be a big issue in the future . The beginning of the matrix assignment was confusing but we were able to figure it out after some time . I liked working things out on my own Matrix operations were slightly confusing as there is a lot of information that needs to be gathered and coded properly Using other complex functions to manipulate your matrix in different ways The matrix manipulation was not fun and there seemed to be an easier way that we could n't figure out how to use matrix manipulation functions The best way to use the ones function to get a 7x7 matrix to get all 10s . How Tom Brady got only a 4 game suspension ? Also the word `` concatenation '' ? The new commands we has to learn such as `` cat '' Some of the instructions for problem 1 were confusing and I had a hard time trying to alter the matrix to have the whole matrix change It was confusing how to use the ones function . We worked our way around it but we 're were n't 100 % sure if that was the right way . it is quite clear Learning how to index different rows and columns in one command was difficult . The matlab page did not explain that very well . I would love to learn more about it The most confusing thing was that using and creating matrix with new commands . Since I am not used to using MATLAB , I had troubles making matrix and replacing values . is pretty clear What other tasks the ` navigator ' should do to help the driver . Certain commands within the program need lots of time to learn the proper syntax . This could have been caused by my lack of preparation before class by not watching the required modules before hand . At times the examples provided to explain the syntax of an operator was not very clear . no Some of the functions were n't explained very well when asking for help Understanding some code and how another person writes code Nothing really , the interim pauses caused me to lose my train of thought occasionally the problem references array indexing and those words in particular somewhat confuse me as to what I should be doing Everything is great . Whether to use parentheses or brackets The most confusing thing was trying to determine what commands did what to the matrix we were manipulating . How do you use the sum function ? Honestly I feel like nothing is being taught to me . The resources given to us that are needed to learn the material are absolutely useless to me and need more explanation Some of the instructions and learning the new commands can be difficult without a lot of help Nothing The paired programming system seemed very disjoint and broke up a lot of the time we were working together ! The functions on matlab Some of the functions we were told to use such as the sum function were pretty confusing and we had to look it up with the limited time we had . What to say when you are the navigator and there is nothing more to be said The ` ones ' function was difficult to use but we figured it out by looking online How to condense the equations and work . As in I understand what needs to be done but do n't know how to condense it . The most confusing part was how PS02 would be submitted . The TA 's did not really know . I was not confused or disoriented about any parts of the class . the only confusing part about class tends to be the algorithm behind this app and the word count . Sometimes the progress bar goes backwards when I type . Some operations were difficult to code even with using resources online and in pst assignments . Additional clarification was required from the TAs Some of the syntax in MATLAB was confusing . Specifically , the sum function and using it to manipulate arrays . Whatever concatenation is . I know it means to link thinks together but I have no idea how I would go about this process It can be confusing to find out how to use certain functions , but we eventually figured it out . Nothing was bad .

"How different commands can affect matrixs and graphs Not to use the scatter command Everything was confusing and we did n't get anywhere with the problem . It was hard and the modules did n't fully explain what we needed to do as well as sometimes it gave us a way to do it that did n't work or was the harder way to do things . Uploading the data files plotting multiple items in the same graph Hold on/off functions The difference between the plot function and the scatter function . Analysis getting the plot to have multiple data points on it I need to work on scatter plots and importing data All of the different ways to code graphs Importing data files was pretty difficult . TA 's helped a lot though . I 'm not really sure how to make a scatter plot without the scatter function . Handling the syntax for loading the files Some of the wording was confusing , specifically the rewording as well as the overlay section . The reordering years thing was hard to understand . Understanding Overlay and relabeling the Years was the most confusing part of the lecture Using new MATLAB functions was tricky but it got better with time . I was n't sure of some of the commands plotting . formatting and creating different plots Finding out about the questions That the number of years would show in decimals at part A in question 2 Create line plot I thought that expanding on the commands that were taught , along with more assistance from the TAs would have been more helpful . It seemed when my pair struggled , the TAs would ridicule us more than provide assistance with things we did not know how to do . The plotting We ran into some trouble with the hold on command . some of the instructions in the problems were somewhat vague Downloading data was fairly difficult and was a challenge for the groups around us Not much really , everything went smoothly . Maybe subplotting ? How to load . txt files properly The most confusing part of today 's class was understanding how Matlab stores figures , creates new ones , and creates legends . Plotting multiple graphs can get confusing . I was never at the point where he was talking about , so I was consistently confused . Switching between plot and scatter The importing confused us . Part c The most confusing part of class was dealing with all the errors matlab gave us . This is because the errors were n't always clear and forced us to pay extra attention to our program . plotting and overlaying multiple graphs on one figure was challenging . Scatter It was difficult to figure out which functions we were supposed to use and whih ones we werent supposed to use . examining airline fares over time How to publish files Most of the stuff in class today . The lecture this class was n't uploaded the whole time , so I did n't know what was going on due to not being able to look back on it . Trying to figure out a lot of the commands could be very confusing at times . I still needed more understanding on subplots and plots . Nothing importing data files Vectors The instructions formatting the two lines and two scatter plots for the calculated vs actual data . Descriptions of the plots , especially the legend , needed more detail in the video to know how to format the entries . Overall formatting I thought importing the data files was alittle confusing Being a first time coder , all of the information is new and confusing . Almost nothing was confusing . I 'm pretty lost in Matlabs right now . Adding gridlines and the `` hold on '' function Team with another guy was a bad idea How to properly create the plots on MATLAB Commands It would be better if we kept our roles for the entire day . It would improve productivity What was the most confusing was the addition of new plots onto previous figures . This caused a lot of trouble for my partner and I because we could n't figure out how to do so . Separating the columns is the most confusing part . Still a bit confused on when certain punctuation is needed for commands Properly importing different types of files onto matlab was difficult Using different complex commands to get the answer we wanted . Understanding the errors when our data would n't load some matrix manipulation calculations especially the concatenation was more complicated to perform due to the requirements to use square brackets instead of the otherwise published methods plotting and syntax was difficult publishing the file and sending it How to get multiple graphs to appear at code execution How to make the plots Formatting the graph It got confusing with all the variables . about the default settings of sum I am still learning how to manipulate the plot including the axis scale and axis limit . The most confusing thing is that there are too many codes to memorize . I think it is clear enough The extra modifiers for the plots Learning how to plot graphs was a bit tricky . There were certain syntax that needed to be learned . Not much this class , this problem was pretty straightforward Some of the instructions were kind of vague on the assignment sheet Those pdf files were not agreeing with us Subplot . How to use certain MATLAB functions to plot things properly . The whole assignment The way course material is taught is n't structured very well . The online modules do n't help me . I 'd prefer a textbook How to load things properly Figuring out how to change rhe color was tough at first , but eventually I figured that out . there was nothing of note Figuring out how to use which functions when and fixing your small errors in them Utilizing the count function and a few of the aspects of the plotting were difficult . Creating the plots were difficult , as there are different functions that do similar things How to write the code when adding color and different shapes . How to format our plots . It was tedious to look up all individual plot specifications . How to plot graphs and how to plot with points or different kinds of lines and markers Figuring out how to plot the graphs correctly and while on top of each other was a little confusing . How to plot and label . What to plot against what . The instructions were very vague too It would be helpful if there was more instruction on the codes in the homework assignment .

Creating the function for problem 2 with inputs and outputs Problem 3 of PS06 The excel manual part is very confusing discerning between SSE and SST values - None I did not understand the regression in matlab very well . The TAs and the Professor are not explaining how we should do the PS problem set very well . I get very confused and I have to seek help from my team to understand how to complete them . the wording of problem 2 Still a little confused about publishing the function with a certain number as the variable . Some of the new excel functions i need to memorize . The most confusing thing was polyfit vs polyval Polyfit and polyval The most confusing part was finding out why we were inputting certain values into our function nothing today Submitting with a specific inputs Nothing really The most confusing thing in class today was how to publish the udf file so it shows everything that you want to display . Using the specific commands and user defined function Introduction was too long Some of the details for how trendlines were to be created and how we were to code them following the course standards was a bit confusing publishing the code by using the price 3 The least squares method on excel is still pretty confusing On problem 2 I thought we had to use two udfs because it was n't very clear I did n't understand how to create the function at first , but eventually our group figured it out There were no confusion in regards with the assignment today .

"when was it needed to use the linear version or the log version of the x and y values Writing general forms of equations Our graph was appearing wrong and we could n't figure it out . Eventually we got help and got it all straightened out so that we could continue with the assignment How we should properly plot the linear line of best fit Nothing currently What some of thr questions were asking in the problem set . Sometimes it was hard to know what to do . Converting from logarithmic to general form by hand The actual manipulation between equations was confusing I felt that the linearization process is a bit confusing as to what we will be graded on .

"The most confusing part is finding what was the error in a fail command . It is a very sensitive process . Explanation of the MATLAB `` matrix dimension '' error message . Everything was well described so I was not confused or in need of more detail . I dont really understand the significance of the scripts how to omit numbers from a vector or matrix that does n't go in order Certain functions should be described throughout the questions instead of the end -LRB- example I did n't know what % did so I had to search for it -RRB- . The difference between a matrix and a vector is confusing . Also , when to use the dot and when to not use it . Following the assignment guidelines . creating a script for the first time . I was confused with script file part of the problem set 1 . Also , unlike ENGR 132 , This did not have unlimited attempts in quizes , so that might be slightly challenging and tough . Some MATLAB concepts were confusing . I find using MATLAB help to be confusing . It does not seem to have a very intuitive search engine and most of the time I find it difficult to find what I 'm looking for . I was confused on how to write natural logs and log functions in MATLAB . The user interface if Matlab is confusing . I 'm not really sure if what I 'm doing is correct , and I do n't know what I do n't know . using the correct syntax The way the problem needs to be submitted needed more detail . The script writting and how to save properly was very dificult and not well explained . I did n't understand what exactly fprintf did for the program The most confusing thing about today 's class was the matrix multiplication vs period character multiplication . Learning to use MATLAB was rather confusing , but having TAS nearby was helpful . Understanding MATLAB and how to code correctly The comma and suppression was not quite clear for me . the most confusing topic was changing the number of decimal places There was nothing that needed more illustration None I did not find anything confusing about today . I enjoy class when we work on our assignments , because the lectures seem to be redundant or do not have much value to our assignments . Todays lecture was nuch better because it helps us complete our given work . How element by element operations can be learned quickly The free version of MATLAB and it 's inconsistent and perplexing performance . I did mot know how to use the `` fprintf '' command in MATLAB . The last part of Problem 3 was sorta confusing what with the decimal places and also the early part of Problem 4 where rows were involved . Saving files is difficult for me as I 'm not always sure how to get files into matlab itself vs. my documents on my computer . The thing I needed more detail on was the process of zipping a folder/file . How to change how many decimal places are displayed How exactly the calculations work because I do n't understand how matrix dimension change via calculations The most confusing part of this class is all the formatting needed to submit problem sets . Confusing functions in matlab like e ^ x More practice with scribe I could not get my Purdue career drive open . Zipping files all together The manual was very self explanatory so I was n't really confused on anything . The most confusing part of the day was trying to find the perfect place to submit your files : whether it was on your drive or the Purdue drive . also how to use matlab since I have n't had any previous experience with it . Nothing really The class today was mostly independent and cpuld have been done outside of class . I didnt feel like i learned much in class today . how to round up the numbers on the answers -LRB- the information was given in the class 3 folder -RRB- They should tell us that they expect us to watch class 3 's module before class 2 because the necessary information about fprintf is in the class 3 module . The introduction to Script Files was the most confusing today . The steps given to have the program path to the right folder was kind of annoying . I felt like it was slightly vague . The script aspect was both interesting and confusing , but I do n't think it was necessarily a bad confusing . Intially , I was confused with how to run the script file , but I managed to resolve it by making edits on the name of my script file . Currently , I am experiencing difficulties in printing numbers of different decimal places . Studio time was not focused and was very short today How to upload data to MATLAB from my computer to the program . I found mapping my drive to be fairly confusing . I ran into a few issues but after reviewing the code or asking a fellow peer I could get the question resolved having enough space to do all the work The problem set and commenting Question 4 , part 5 could be explained better . Descriptions of syntax in the ps01 , what parts are needed ; spacing ' ; ' etc. . I think how to create a zip file and submit our work was a little confusing Some of the different error messages are confusing . Most of the time I am not sure what they mean . We should get more detail on where we can go to fix these issues . The syntax for limiting the amount of places after the decimal that was asked for . Saving files and creating the zipper file is still a little unclear . Opening files in MATLAB Learning the different ways to express a vector is something that i am still struggling with , specifically `` linspace '' Nothing is confusing Some specific things about vectors in MATLAB . I was confused on the round command Finding help online The vector and matrix math operations . Also the problem sheet was vague in some areas . I think that the in the word document problem sheet it would have been better to have the little help controls for each part of the problems before the charts to fill in the answers so that I would have known that it was there to help me with the problem . Saving script files in MATLAB is a little bit confusing . You really have to make sure that you select this correct folder and ensure that the name of the script file is created correctly . However , this was n't that difficult to figure out with some time . The complicated calculations were a little confusing . I 'm good right now , but I 'm sure something will come up . Complex calculations with multiple variables are confusing and could use more details on how to effectively solve them through MATLAB . Understanding the typing and format to use the different commands in MATLAB the MATLAB program in general confused me as I am still unable to inadeuqtley find the necessary resources to assist me with the problems . I 've watched the online modules that were required prior to this class , however they are not providing me with much assistance when I try to use and interact with MATLAB the syntax of some of the matlab functions is a little odd how to save to places other than your Purdue career account Learning the syntax of matlab The later problems in the problem set Nothing was confusing . I am still confused about how to suppress lines of code using a semi-colon I needed a lot of help just being able to use the remote access to be able to use MATLAB . Thankfully , I was helped and was able to end up accessing the the site and could start work . I 'm still new to programming so the syntax is not familiar It is still hard to fully understand which matrix requires dot product and which does not . Sometimes no dot product is required but other times it only accepts the dot product . I also wish to learn what calculation is done when the matrix are multiplied without the dot operator . The confusing thing was that using script , because I had some errors at the beginning of the class . some part of the suppress code stuff confuse at first Finding out modifications on functions for MATLAB on Problem set 1 - 3 Learning new syntax / getting used to MATLAB . everything is clear . TA helps a lot The depth we need to go into for our problem set answers Coding can be very tedious since everything has to be exact . Sometimes I could n't see all my output but the professor explained why this occurred and the problem was solved . Coursemirror crashed twice There are warnings if we do n't add simicolon at the end of each command in the script . The requirements of assignments -LRB- specifically PS01 and commenting requirements -RRB- . Also examples of what we should n't do would be nice . Everything because I 've never coded a day in my life or have even heard of / seen these programs . Formatting output to a number of decimals . The website provided in PS01 did n't give enough detail . Doing some of the instructions while using software remote can be frustrating . There was no particular topic I had problems with . How to use my VPN on problem 3 It was very confusing to figure out how and where to save our matlab files , and also what we had to save . Mapping and saving the files The many different commands can be confusing & overwhelming , but I 'm sure it will get easier with time How to use fprintf correctly . I was a little confused on where I should be placing code , initializations , and calculations . I was very lost at the beginning of class but figured it out eventually . I thought that the research survey was repetitive . The survey asked the same questions repeatedly and with similar phrasing . I found it to be confusing and slightly irritating . Another thing I found irritating and confusing is the progress bar for this app . Sometimes I write more words and the progress bar goes backwards which does not make sense . Other times , it skips from halfway done to all the way done without warning . I had issues running my script files in the command window in problem 3 before the section where you have to add semi colons . Certain syntax was confusing and hard to use . For example , the fprintf command is confusing . Whatever a zip file or folder is , no clue what that is Figuring out what functions needed to be used for certain tasks . It would be more helpful if there were an easier way and quicker way to do these reflections . @extractive","Learning the specific syntax was the most challenging for the students .
