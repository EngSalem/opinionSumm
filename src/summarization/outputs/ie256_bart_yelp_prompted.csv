"Students had trouble knowing when to use R , and would have liked more examples . Some students had trouble using Rstudio . They were also concerned about the questions in the practice session , as they did not get to go over them .","Most of the students found the last two questions of the second ps session as confusing. Some others had problems with the 3rd and 4th ps questions, and others struggled with the ps TA making simple questions look more complicated."
"In this lecture students really only had problems with F distributions . There were a few students with problems such as intervals and standard error , but most students either had no problems or trouble with F distributions .","Most of the students found everything clear. Some students had trouble with the F Distribution and variance intervals, especially the intervals between S-1-square and S-2-square. A few students also had problems with chi squared distributions and degrees of freedom."
"In this lecture students were mainly interested by paired observations and pooled variance . They also liked dealing with dependence , unequal variances , and using the t-distribution in new ways .","Most of the students found paired observations and pooled variance interesting. Some others enjoyed comparing two sampl, comparing means, and calculating degrees of freedom when the sample variance was equal."
