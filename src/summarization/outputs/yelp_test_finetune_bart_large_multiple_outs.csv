"This is trendy, upscale Chinese restaurant that sometimes hits a home run of food, but often misses the target when it comes to service. It's in a great location, clean, comfortable, and attractive on the inside. Sometimes, items on the menu are on point and offer generous portions, but other things are overly complex or drenched in too much MSG. The prices are up, and the service is often unreliable as servers can sometimes have an attitude or completely fail at being attentive.","This is a nice Chinese restaurant that offers a wide variety of dim sum, congee, and other dishes. The dim sum is very well-liked, but the service can be a bit lacking at times. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends). Also be careful to check your bill before you pay. Overall,"
"A very elegant space. The food was quite expensive, everything was pretty good and really unique.  But the service delivery was very bad. The waiters were always in a hurry, talk dictatively and rudely, they also delivered dishes to wrong table.","This is a nice Chinese restaurant that offers a wide variety of dim sum, congee, and other dishes.

"This dim sum restaurant has mixed results. The food itself is fine, however the service leaves something to be desired. Servers are known for being unfriendly and inattentive. The price is fine, but unless the service improves, the restaurant is not recommended.","This is a nice Chinese restaurant that offers a wide variety of dim sum, congee, and other dishes.

"This location is frustrating to deal with and rarely has pizzas hot and read between 4 - 8 pm, as advertised. They have very poor customer service and it's difficult to get through on the phone at times. Sometimes, the pizzas don't taste great, needing more sauce and cheese. Overall, not recommended.","This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. They are always behind, and they have very poor customer service skills.

"The seafood here is great, especially filet perch, fried oysters, and the crab legs on Tuesdays. For the ones that don't like seafood, there is also chicken and steak.
