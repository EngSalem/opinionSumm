There were a few students with problems such as intervals and standard error , but most students either had no problems or trouble with F distributions .","A little under 1/3 of students found everything clear. A few students had trouble with F Distribution, variance intervals, and the use of F Distribution in estimation. A couple students also had problems with chi squared distributions and degrees of freedom."
"In this lecture students were mainly interested by paired observations and pooled variance . They also liked dealing with dependence , unequal variances , and using the t-distribution in new ways .","Many students found pooled variance, paired observations, and pooled variance interesting. Some students also found difference disyribution, comparing samples, and degrees of freedom interesting."
