The salsa bar is a little underwhelming, but it is more than made up for by everything else. The food can be good or bad depending on the type of food ordered. Overall, this is a good place to get away from Chipotle or Taco Bell."
"The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender. However, it might be wise to avoid Sunday brunch as the food tends to be dry and burnt.","West Alley BBQ is one of the best barbecue joints in town. The quality of the meat is top-shelf, and the service is always top notch. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is cozy and the ambience is cozy. The food is very good, but the service can be a bit lacking at times. Overall, this is a highly recommended place."
