The quality is good but the material is thin making it good for layering.","The only reason I'm rating this at two stars is because it is listed as a 'long' tank top and the photo even shows it going well past the models hips, however I'm short and the tank top is just a normal length. The material is thin and tends to run a bit small. Overall, this is a good quality tank that is comfortable to wear.","['good,tank', 'quality,tank']"
