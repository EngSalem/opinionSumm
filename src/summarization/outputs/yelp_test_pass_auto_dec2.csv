gUQXksFGvShjSl7Xil41bQ,"Came here to have my IPAD4 cracked screen fixed and they did a fantastic job and at a really affordable price. Definitely worth a try if you have a need to repair you tablet or phone. Will update if there are any problems but they have a 30 day warranty.

It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping.

i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw,"I love this neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable. Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven. It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!! The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub! Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix. I grew up with Rafaelle's Pizza. One of 2 places from which my family would order. Both places are still in business! The pizza is great and the lunch specials are a fair deal as well! Still consistently great after 30 years! I really love the Sicilian pizza here. This pizza is perfect for 5-6 people.The New York style pizza here is also very good. You can't beat it in Phoenix. This pizza reminds me of living back East. I don't have a picture. I ate it all. The best pizza place in the Valley just happens to be the first pizza my wife and I went to when we moved out here almost 11 years ago. The pizza is straightforward and delicious, the wings are sneaky good and the staff is great. If you're in the area, stop in - you won't regret it!

The food was a bit better than average but nothing to knock your socks off. A good place to go with family or friends.They have a cheese sauce that is a bit spicy but tasty! Great location and atmosphere. Authentic and Mexican American fare that was served in generous portions and DELICIOUS! The Guadalajara burrito was simple and SO flavorful. Hubs had Molcalambres and ranked them near the top of his fajita list. Not hoiity toity; not trying to be hip and trendy like Maize. Will come back whenever in town. Love this place! The waitstaff is great and friendly, they are very quick but also allow you to relax and not feel rushed. I go here in the summer with some friends and we just sit on the patio (great outdoor seating) and drink margaritas and enjoy the complimentary fresh chips and salsa. Also great food! They took a while to bring the food, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla that was very soggy and tasteless, the rest of the food was edible but far from good, place was ok, it's far from the best but if you hungry and desperate you can certainly go eat there. Good food at a great price, the restaurant has become a great lunch destination. The food is basic American-Mexican combinations (burrito, enchilada, tamale for example) with very quick service. Honestly have not been to a sit down restaurant with such speedy service during the lunch rush. Their food is decent, but the reason I'm writing this review is their healthy margarita. It's incredible and I'm not even usually a margarita fan! My husband ordered the regular margarita and we both agreed that the healthy was much better than the regular margarita. Go try it! The first time I went here, I ordered a taco salad with beef, and the beef was pink. Not brown on the outside and pink on the inside, pink pink pink. The second time I went, my friend and I had the same burrito combination platter and both of us got sick the next day. Went here with a group to drink some margaritas and eat some chips and salsa. Wonderful service and friendly staff. I ordered a grande raspberry margarita and it was nice and strong. Chips were hot and delicious and salsa was good (wish it was spicier but that's a personal preference)","This American-Mexican restaurant serves good tasty good.

ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w,"Food was strictly ok, I've had way better dimsum. The service was pretty bad - the waiter kept coming by to see if we were done eating starting at 9: 30pm, when the restaurant closes at 10pm. I wouldn't go back. I don't have a lot of good things to say about this place except that the food is decent but service is lacking. This restaurant is relatively new but will not last long if they do not change / improve things. Food is good but service needs to be improved (they are understaffed). We had a great time at Kwan. The food wasn't cheap, but everything was really unique and pretty good. Service and staff was nice and friendly. I'd say the dim sum is comparable to uptown restaurants. This is a good choice if you live in midtown of Toronto. Came here for the first time today for dim sum. I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly. Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption. Overall, the depth & complexity of the dim sum left me wanting for dim sum from Richmond Hill instead. I won't be back. Hands down this is my new favorite go to for tasty and healthier Chinese. We tried 10 different dim sum items and they were all excellent and not drenched in oil. The space is quite elegant and the service was above average. Was feeling under the weather one day at work so I decided to get some congee for takeout. I ordered the congee with century egg and pork for $5. It definitely hit the spot and was a good portion. Would like to return and try the dim sum some day! As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service.

ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w,"Food was strictly ok, I've had way better dimsum. The service was pretty bad - the waiter kept coming by to see if we were done eating starting at 9: 30pm, when the restaurant closes at 10pm. I wouldn't go back. I don't have a lot of good things to say about this place except that the food is decent but service is lacking. This restaurant is relatively new but will not last long if they do not change / improve things. Food is good but service needs to be improved (they are understaffed). We had a great time at Kwan. The food wasn't cheap, but everything was really unique and pretty good. Service and staff was nice and friendly. I'd say the dim sum is comparable to uptown restaurants. This is a good choice if you live in midtown of Toronto. Came here for the first time today for dim sum. I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly. Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption. Overall, the depth & complexity of the dim sum left me wanting for dim sum from Richmond Hill instead. I won't be back. Hands down this is my new favorite go to for tasty and healthier Chinese. We tried 10 different dim sum items and they were all excellent and not drenched in oil. The space is quite elegant and the service was above average. Was feeling under the weather one day at work so I decided to get some congee for takeout. I ordered the congee with century egg and pork for $5. It definitely hit the spot and was a good portion. Would like to return and try the dim sum some day! As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends) .Also be careful to check your bill before you pay.","This dim sum restaurant has mixed results. The food itself is fine, however the service leaves something to be desired. Servers are known for being unfriendly and inattentive. The price is fine, but unless the service improves, the restaurant is not recommended.","This is a nice Chinese restaurant in midtown Toronto. The food is good, but the service can be a bit lacking at times. The staff is generally friendly and attentive, but can be in a rush sometimes.

jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"This is probably my favorite Persian cuisine resturant in Vegas. The place is nicely decorated and very clean. I am very impressed with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab.... Amazing! It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though. Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here. The family platter we got was sooo good, would definitely return! I also really liked the sour milk yogurt drink they have here. If you are looking for great Iranian (Persian) or Mediterranean food this is the place to go! They have the best food and the greatest customer service. If you are in Vegas stop by this place, don't miss out on it! I am very excited that I found this restaurant. They offer a very good lunch special menu with good prices for generous portions of delicious food. I plan on returning often. The beef koobideh kabob was succulent and the side salad was refreshingly bright. I highly recommend American Gypsy Cafe. I stop by for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in Vegas. I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience! Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent. Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself. Falafel appetizer and hummus are great starters and the beef koobideh kabobs are great. My friend had the chicken koobideh kabob and loved it. Lunch specials have great deals too. I saw ants in the kitchen area on the way to bathroom. Do not eat here!!! Omg unsanitary. Be aware!! I canceled my order and left asap. You could get staph infection from ants and other bugs.

What can I say, Eno Vino is one of my top 5 in Madtown. The small plates are better than full meals at some places, and of course the wine selection is outstanding. But probably the most significant draw that really puts the icing on the cake is the location and VIEW. Great photo ops and ambience for a nice Barolo and bruschetta plate. This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing. Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them. Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro! Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby. I live the original Eno vino way better in term of serving speed and quality of services including the way cheeseboard is not being served with wood board here in downtown location.

I would say prices are the middle of the road. It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend! Had a good experience at the Wexford location. We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back! Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat. So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened. This place is always delicious. The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours. The burgers were perfect cooked to order and the staff was friendly Great menu - lots of different menu ideas for the area! Love the Thai salad and homewrecker sandwich! Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!! Not yo 'stereotypical dive bar with a healthy craft draft list and some unexpected twists on burgers, sammies, and appetizers. The sweet potato tots will satisfy even the sweetest of tooths especially with the cinnamon + brown sugar butter dip that comes with. Surprisingly addictive.

keJGpYownJ-j2zQJ5huvqg,"Pretty cool bar and a neat area of town. Off the beaten path of regular tourist attractions. Place has been around for a long time and the Mac n Cheese options are plentiful and pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere and good service. We hiked up [what felt like] a bazillion hills to get here and I can't be upset about it because everything was so good. It was Saturday brunch and we had the mimosas, which seemed heavy on the champagne so no complaints. Everyone loved every item they ordered. Good local hang out! The staff can be hit or miss but the food is always good.My favorites are the fried pickles and the grilled cheese burger. It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold. Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous. Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot! Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch. What a great local bar / restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night. We love it h Brunch with the wife and some friends GREAT food and service I would recommend the Bloody Mary very good - top notch even we really Like the atmosphere, the new Bar area looks great! we will definitely be back for dinner and drinks","In the neighborhood, it's definitely the best burger.

keJGpYownJ-j2zQJ5huvqg,"Pretty cool bar and a neat area of town. Off the beaten path of regular tourist attractions. Place has been around for a long time and the Mac n Cheese options are plentiful and pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere and good service. We hiked up [what felt like] a bazillion hills to get here and I can't be upset about it because everything was so good. It was Saturday brunch and we had the mimosas, which seemed heavy on the champagne so no complaints. Everyone loved every item they ordered. Good local hang out! The staff can be hit or miss but the food is always good.My favorites are the fried pickles and the grilled cheese burger. It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold. Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous. Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot! Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch. What a great local bar / restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night.

Wish we had one in Nashville...... in my Street.... in my House. Best gelato, so creamy and full of flavor! The cheesecake gelato tastes like actual cheesecake! And you can sample every flavor if you want! The creamy cookie is also delicious! A perfect treat for a hot Arizona day! I can't wait to come back! Yes! Real, creamy, flavorful gelato.

The best Gelato! I always go with my family and recommend my clients here. The shop is super cute inside and the owners are so nice and welcoming All the time. You can try samples which makes it hard cause they are all so good! Highly recommended!! My 9 year old son and I tried Pussycat Gelato for the 1st time. The gelato was amazing and we would return from ahwatukee again. The partners who own the shop were generous in telling us all about the gelato and providing numerous samples. When my 9 year old couldn't decide what flavor, the owner allowed him to have 4 flavors in his cup. This place was fantastic! The flavors were both fresh and intense.

I eat ice cream every single day and I can honestly tell you that this is the best ice cream / gelato / yogurt total experience I have ever had. Don't miss a visit here.

Great places to shop and eat after or before a movie. I would recommend this theatre to anybody. Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time. Nice way to get more for your dollar. I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience Love it here there's always plenty of room Harkins Theatres and lots of things to do in this little shopping plaza, there's lots of good food a lots of good shopping around here all the family and kids living around here it's nice Harkins is an amazing company.

I'm disappointed Never coming back to this restaurant again! The staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. My husband found a hair in his food and the manager didn't want to re-make his order nor give him a refund. Stay away from this restaurant! Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw. Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ. Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right. Side dishes are average. Takamatsu was way better. No kimbap. Probably won't be back. This place is pretty good. There are not a lot of Korean BBQ spots in Arizona that actually have grills. We sat in a nice booth and the table had a grill. The side dishes are not as good as other places. The meats were delicious. Overall we enjoyed this place and will be going back. My first time to this place and it was so delicious. The Siracha Honey Pork Shoulder was our absolute favorite! Such unique food and a unique experience. We are stuffed! The prices are super reasonable and the flavor is superb. We will definitely be back. This will become the newest hottest spot in the east valley! Food is amazing, ambiance is very nice, workers are so pleasant, very nice hangout place!

This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here! Great service!

Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out! What a great new beer and wine bar! We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap... thanks for the great recommendation! Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio. Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall.

Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly!

mmKrNeBIIevuNljAWVNgXg,"Tim and Tami always always always have the best customer service and do the best nails. I will NEVER go anywhere else. Even after weeks my nails look and feel as good as they did when I first got them done! I'm so dedicated I recommend and bring in all my friends! Definitely my new nail salon! Everyone is so friendly and kind, I felt so welcomed! B did an amazing job on my nails. He made sure everything was perfect and happily changed something to make me happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants A + work at a totally affordable price. Love it!!:) Amazing service and nails. This is the second time I have been here, they did a perfect job again. They get it done fast yet with precision. Everyone is so friendly there too. Best nail salon I have ever been too. I'm glad I found it. I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out. My first set of acrylics ever... I decided 27 years was a lot enough time to wait, and I'm SO happy with them. I'm not a huge nail person, and was glad to stumble upon this salon. My nail tech was quiet, clean, and very detail-oriented. Very pleased with my experience here and I recommend this place. I called to make an appointment for later today for 3 adults and 2 kids and the man who answered the phone said 'we only have 2 techs today' we can't do that.

Ended up having to go back up and tell them we needed to change it to go. Spent 20 minutes inside just to come out with a bag of food to eat in the car. This place is awesome! They have added breakfast and a Freestyle Coke Machine! There are so many choices and things to try. I love the drive thru and the inside is very comfortable and clean. You can tell that the place has been around awhile but the workers take pride in what they do. Delicious! Must try! 0820 in the am, the sign open wasn't on the mgr didn't even know, the inside was dirty, the soda machine disgusting, the countertops dirty, the floor dirty, the counter where you pick up food had crumbs all over it, this place needs the health department stat! Never going back! I decided to have a sandwich and was craving the chewy bread from Schlotzsky. So I walked in and got the Turkey Bacon Club on sourdough. It was very good. Got the original chips and an ice tea. The store was clean, nice, and has a lot of seating areas. The staff was very friendly and nice. Nasty, rude employees. The bathrooms are horrible.

nm9aJr7qQadbkTP6lnXB1Q,"Have gone here for over ten years. Great customers and good food. However, constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, replacing the old with the new doesn't always work. Wings were amazing. Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them. Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this 'our place'. Closed. Sad but true Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting. Service is 'OK'. Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way. If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!! I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious. I also love their Wing Wednesday deal. 79 cent wings and they have @ 6 flavors. Plus they give you choice of fried or grilled. Awesome!","A bar that has been a mainstay in the area for many years.

However, constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, replacing the old with the new doesn't always work. Wings were amazing. Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them. Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this 'our place'. Closed. Sad but true Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting. Service is 'OK'. Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way. If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!! I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious.

LOVE this place! I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere! As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for. It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks.

oAq3-dXyDT3k4Mluc1ftTA,"nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation! Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure. One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality. I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)! The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again. Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass. Plenty of better options in the area. Will not be going back to this place. I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups! I had the ribeye steak combo medium rare. It was so soft and buttery and just so good!!

Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality. I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)! The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again. Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass. Plenty of better options in the area. Will not be going back to this place. I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups! I had the ribeye steak combo medium rare. It was so soft and buttery and just so good!! The server was so nice and it was just a good time! got there around 2 during the lunch hours and there was no wait time. Very good food! Very entertaining show!",The teppanyaki and sashimi at this restaurant are recommended and both are very good. The service is very good and the place has an entertaining atmosphere and the prices are very reasonable for the food you get. Overall this place is recommended.,"This is a great place for a good teppanyaki dinner. The staff is friendly and professional, the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice.

They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lol This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8, blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it. Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere... This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.. Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait... Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies. 0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again. I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He / she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape.

on5wA9xgE-HZyBp19-yxsg,"I had Angel and she was WONDERFUL. Not a single complaint about her or the establishment. She was very attentive, as was the manager. Making sure everyone was satisfied and checking on his employees. Definitely my new nail place! I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it! This place always does an excellent job! The people are so sweet and great at what they do. My gel manicures last the longest when they are done here! I don't know what they do differently but the polish seems to stay on longer without chipping or peeling off. This has become my go to nail place. Well that was a disappointment. Sign said open until 6pm. I walked in the door at 5: 25pm the gentleman that saw me said come on in, however some lady cane running up and told me 'no, closed'. I won't give it another try I would not recommend this salon. I was very dissapointed. I told the girl doing my pedicure that I am diabetic and to be very careful doing my feet. She cut me three times resulting in six visits to my doctor and two rounds of antibiotics. I went to tell the manager what happened and they were very rude and never even offered an apology.

Making sure everyone was satisfied and checking on his employees. Definitely my new nail place! I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it! This place always does an excellent job! The people are so sweet and great at what they do. My gel manicures last the longest when they are done here! I don't know what they do differently but the polish seems to stay on longer without chipping or peeling off. This has become my go to nail place. Well that was a disappointment. Sign said open until 6pm. I walked in the door at 5: 25pm the gentleman that saw me said come on in, however some lady cane running up and told me 'no, closed'. I won't give it another try I would not recommend this salon. I was very dissapointed. I told the girl doing my pedicure that I am diabetic and to be very careful doing my feet.

Be sure to ask for almond milk if you are vegan:) The barista was so kind to change it out for my friend and I as we forgot to ask about other milk alternatives. Great idea and they use Averys roastery for their coffee! That means the coffee is yummy! The customer service is great! They just need to grow a little! Support them, they deserve it! I highly recommend an AEROPRESS! Love finding local gems like this! Really cute space, stage for open mic nights, an incredible amount of board games, and really creative drink menu. The barista was so kind and friendly, giving us drink recommendations that we loved. I had the bath bomb iced tea and it was very unique and tasty. Cam in the other day and was pleasantly surprised! Really cute and rooms of fun looking games. Ordered espresso on ice and jazzed it up a bit. Really good espresso. Took my kiddo a cookie and it was amazing! Owner was working and recommended it. I'll be back for sure. This is one my family's favorite chill spots. Jupiter and RJ are always so friendly and helpful. So clutch with the drinks; Emilio, Arnold Schwarzen-Palmer, and PO Double G are legit!!!

He looks amazing when they are done! He LOVES going there and everyone who works there is so nice and friendly! The facility is very clean. Their pricing is comparable to other places, but we know our dog is in good hands when he goes there! Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner. We've been loyal customers since it opened. Our cavalier always looks amazing after being groomed here. I love that they also have a do-it-yourself pet-bath option. The staff always listens and is helpful. Very clean facility too. I brought in my two Pugs here and they loved it! They were pampered and walked out of there smelling good and clean. Of course, that didn't last long because those two love to get dirty. Furry Beginnings is a great place to bring your fur baby. The staff is amazing and very caring! You'll love this place! Best groomer in Gilbert. The owners love dogs and people! The grooming is reasonable in price and the dog wash is fun for people and dogs too. They have great staff and a good selection of leashes, collars and other dog lover items. We always get great treatment for our two yorkies from Darcy. She is great and really cares about our spoiled little girls. We moved a bit farther away and still value and trust them with our doggies that we don't even think about taking them anywhere else. We are always thrilled with their looks and the way we are treated!","Furry Beginnings is a great place to groom dogs; they offer a do-it-yourself pet-bath, the staff is nice and friendly to dogs and people alike.

p0bg7la5-gaUJyBDjuOCxA,"I've been taking two dogs to Furry Beginnings for about a year. One precious little mini schnauzer has gone to her reward but the other, my beautiful Zelda, has another appointment tomorrow. I've been happy with the results each time and will continue to use this groomer. The staff and the owner are among the nicest people ever! My dog Mindy had her first grooming here since moving to Arizona. Everyone seemed very professional and Mindy looks great. I like the fact that they are kennel free. Rather opting to have pens with beds for each pet. The salon is very clean and the pricing is right where it should be. I'll be taking my dog there again!

I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!! I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good.

The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes. I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight! Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored. This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well. Very impressed. Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome!!!! Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!! I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment. I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend. The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots. Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well.

Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!! I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment. I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend. The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots. Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well. But it was hot and tasted fresh. I was informed that if I wanted the condiments that I would have to come to the restaurant myself to get them.","This is a good place to spend time with friends or go watch the game. They always have tons of beer on tap and the prices of drinks are reasonable. The food is standard bar food, with fun items like cheesy fries and bacon-wrapped poppers. Also, the atmosphere is great with good music.","This is a great place for parties and date nights. The atmosphere is great and the bar is top notch. The food is pretty good for bar food.

qSa3L7cy8Gju4ZLs50ycag,"This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy. Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant! The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back. It's like eating watered down butter with oysters incorporated into it. Highly highly highly recommend CAPTAIN D's;) I am NOT a shellfish fan but the seafood here is really good along w / the hushpuppies! Was recommended by a person I work with and I am glad I went--and have gone several times since then. Just be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line. I don't eat seafood, but they have great chicken and steak for anyone who doesn't like seafood! The place looks very cool on the inside as if you are at the beach. The hush puppies are to die for!! I had the filet of perch and fried oysters and man... They were great! Great portion size for 14 bucks. Even though I got fried it wasn't greasy. I got it to go but the place looked pretty cool to eat at! The fries and hush puppies were good. I will return. It's been awhile since I have been here, but the crab legs were always fantastic. Family friendly restaurant with the best service. The complimentary hushpuppies are delicous and fresh. If you want good home cooking and delish seafood or fish, I will always recommend this place! Awesome fish camp. Portions are very large even with the small ones. The food is amazing! There always super busy so be ready to wait especially on the weekends. We call in a lot to and the staff is always nice and very efficient.","The seafood here is great, especially filet perch, fried oysters, and the crab legs on Tuesdays.

Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks! Fast and Friendly service! Absolutely delicious!! Seriously finger licking good! The ribs fall right off the bone and they are juicy. I can't wait to go back and try the other items. They also have a daily special every day and it includes sides and a drink. I went in today and everyone was so nice and with a great attitude.

tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"The food is so good and so fresh we had to come back two days in a row. Although their menu is very simple, it is very delicious and satisfying. Do not forget to ask for some lava sauce. Its not teriyaki sauce or bbq sauce. It's lava sauce because it is made with lave (love).;) Food tastes good, i had the chicken box, which is grilled chicken with white rice and steamed vegetables. This is a great spot to stop grab a great meal and go about your day. I'll definitely be back and recommend this business.Good place for a quick meal, nothing fancy but adequate. Cheap, tasty meal! Very happy I tried this place. I ordered grilled chicken with brown rice and veggies. Total bill was under $5.00! Definitely worth a visit and I may have found my go-to lunch place!:) Ate here yesterday afternoon. We both had chicken on noodles with veggies. We both enjoyed it and felt it was good value for reasonable price.Owner was friendly and restaurant was clean. I like when I can see my food being prepared and here you can.I live 4 miles away so I will definitely be back. Best grilled teriyaki chicken, beef, salmon, pork, and short ribs in town and the prices are amazing. There's not enough praises I can say to this establishment. Very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Great food, great owners! I got the chicken bowl and my wife got the beef bowl both were great. The taste reminnds me of ha ing those bbq cookouts out in hawaii. One thing i would buy is a shirt cuz i like the logo and the place. The food here is surprisingly good and flavorful. The best part is that it is highly affordable. I paid about $5 for a full meal. It does take a while for them to cook it, so be sure to call ahead to place your order. LAVA GRILL!!!! Where do i start....... The food is great, service is good. The food is fairly priced and very very flavorful. You get to choose between white or brown. 1.50 for extra meat. The lava sauce is delicious. I would recommend anybody to come here. Good place for lunch or dinner.","The value of the menu choices is very high, along with the food being very flavorful.

I had the tonkotsu miso ramen and ended up finishing the whole thing. The flavor was so good and that egg... mmm! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I am so happy I found this place! love the authenticity of this place! takoyaki, ramen, gyoza so delicious and flavor is spot-on. pricey but the politeness and friendliness of the staff outshines. i have taken friends here to eat and they love it, family loves it too. portion is large, you will go home very full and happy. I've never had real Ramen before and now I can't live without it. There isn't anything on the menu that is bad (except the tea but you don't go there for the tea). I would drink the broth by the gallon if I could. I can't go a few days without going back. Love this place!!! I had the coconut Thia ramen and my whole table tried to steal it from me-so good. My daughter got the curry chicken cutlet- yummy. I would ask for the curry on the side because this portion has more that enough for left overs and you don't want it to be soggy. My husband and I are so happy that Yume has opened near our home! The 20 hour pork broth used on the ramen is the ultimate comfort food. This restaurant is fabulous. We are looking forward to trying other dishes. The restaurant and the very friendly and helpful owners exceeded our expectations. Best ramen in NC. Took a two hour drive from Raleigh to try this place. Owner is from SF and worked at SF Japan town ramen place before. The soup base is the real stuff, not fake powders like other places. Will come back again for sure. Awesome ramen. We tried the Shio ramen and miso ramen; both were made very well. Agedashii tofu and pork curry bowls were equally tasty. Prices are not cheap but aren't outrageous either. We met the owners, they're a very nice couple. We'll definitely be back.","This has authentic Japanese dishes with amazing flavors.

Our food was delicious, dim sum were all very fresh and the wines were great too. Would thoroughly recommend. Dim sum was on point! Service was ridiculously slow. Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for. Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip. We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns! I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent! The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast.

ypSAad4wGe3Uh0N6dgVxaw,"Mgr Dave and salesman Kevin Campbell made the deal very easy for me.!!! My family really loves the car... First Porsche e hybrid I have had .Great car...... modern car tech at its bestGreat experience .I look forward to many more deals with them.Kevin Campbell one of the best salespeople I have experienced in 40 years of buying cars .Bravo Kevin!! Family has purchased a total of 3 purchases within the last 10 years here and the service has been more than excellent. We had an issue with one of the cars, and they fixed it and allowed us to drive a newer model while ours was in repair. This was my first experience at Porsche North Scottsdale and couldn't have been better. Kevin was clear in his explanations and communicated as he said he would. I am very happy with the Macan I bought even having had one service experience to install window tinting. Got taken with efficiency, no waiting, car ready on time. Great customer service all around. Excellent dealership that Prides itself on service and attentiveness. No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman. The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better. I have come to expect more from a Penske company. Just bought a Porsche Panamera s and absolutely love the car! I wish I would have bought one sooner. Owned high end Lexus, Audi, BMW and Mercedes and I like this car best.Got a fair deal and the sale consultant Mark Siffert made it easy and painless. Overall an excellent experience! The best customer service ever! My son wanted the experience of riding in a 911 Turbo. We had the nicest salesman, named Nick, took us for a one of a kind test drive and made my son's day! Absolutely the coolest salesman ever! Kevin Campbell exceeded my expectations! His knowledge of both new and used cars at the dealership was amazing. This was my first purchase at this dealership and won't be my last. My experience in buying was hassle free and professional. Thank you!","This is a great Porche dealer, highly recommended. The salesmen are knowledgeable, friendly, and are not pushy. The car buying process is easy, and the customer gets a fair deal with little or no hassle.

ypSAad4wGe3Uh0N6dgVxaw,"Mgr Dave and salesman Kevin Campbell made the deal very easy for me.!!! My family really loves the car... First Porsche e hybrid I have had .Great car...... modern car tech at its bestGreat experience .I look forward to many more deals with them.Kevin Campbell one of the best salespeople I have experienced in 40 years of buying cars .Bravo Kevin!! Family has purchased a total of 3 purchases within the last 10 years here and the service has been more than excellent. We had an issue with one of the cars, and they fixed it and allowed us to drive a newer model while ours was in repair. This was my first experience at Porsche North Scottsdale and couldn't have been better. Kevin was clear in his explanations and communicated as he said he would. I am very happy with the Macan I bought even having had one service experience to install window tinting. Got taken with efficiency, no waiting, car ready on time. Great customer service all around. Excellent dealership that Prides itself on service and attentiveness. No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman. The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better. I have come to expect more from a Penske company. Just bought a Porsche Panamera s and absolutely love the car! I wish I would have bought one sooner. Owned high end Lexus, Audi, BMW and Mercedes and I like this car best.Got a fair deal and the sale consultant Mark Siffert made it easy and painless. Overall an excellent experience! The best customer service ever! My son wanted the experience of riding in a 911 Turbo. We had the nicest salesman, named Nick, took us for a one of a kind test drive and made my son's day!

zHAR8MmCbjrkNnLGm1ozEQ,"The food is good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. I became an instant Rivas fan after trying what I think is the best chicken burrito in town. Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well. Goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. Three stars because the food was edible. Ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. The three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. It's okay, but not great. This place is very delicious. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the California burrito and they were all very delicious. The horchata and jaimaca are also very good! I definitely recommend this place, don't ever go back to Roberto's! Food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans. Friendly service, Tv was so loud it was uncomfortable, staff didn't seem to mindAs I'm eating a overwhelming smell of pinesol cleaner overtook the taste of my food. Between loud TV and cleaner, I won't be back The wife and I moved to area from San Diego. Heard good about this place. The food looked great. We got our order and it was cold.

Ordered through Uber eats. Got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. The enchiladas and fries were good. But the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and 'plain nachos' is just chips. I figured nachos would at least come with cheese.

zJzkL4VHHksVVGepR1IAGw,"I do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary. I wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food. What does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini. Food here is really good however I will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them. Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing. My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit. Halifax donair all the way. Back room for a reso is a must. Great space for a 8 - 12 person party. Didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. Same goes for the scallops. The Notorious PIG was a hit with our group. Went to have brunch for Mother's Day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! Had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! The toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy! I'm excited to go back for dinner! Sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious hopgoods foodliner delivers exactly what I'm after: flavour! And lots of it. Service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's liking.Sweetbreads, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and Donairs are what we tried. 4.5 stars! The food was delicious! The wait staff really friendly and attentive. Probably some of the best I've ever had. We tried the crispy pig ear salad, oysters, donairs, Lobster Spaghetti, Cauliflower clams and crispy toffee for desert. I would definitely not leave without trying the Lobster Spaghetti.","The food here is amazing, especially the beignets and the toffee dessert. The service can be hit or miss but are friendly to deal with. This is a nice place that can seat a larger party. They have delicious menu options for brunch, lunch and dinner with unique and creative menu options.","This restaurant offers a wide variety of food and drinks.

I was left with a mouth full of bland flavoring and had to constantly add sauces and salsa to every bite to give it taste. Price wasn't bad. Portions were nice. Just lacking in flavor and taste. i ordered the water street with chicken. i got the water street with beef. the manager quickly fixed my order. fantastic customer service. 5 stars. follow up. my second burrito got me sick. the rice was hard and there was hardly any chicken or fillings. i have food poisoning, and i will not return to this restaurant.beware! Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself.Was a little confused about the ordering system. The prices are also a little much but the food was very good. Had the grilled fish tacos and the queso and they were both wonderful! Highly recommend if you're looking to get away from Chipotle or Taco Bell. This is a nice spot that offers gluten free options. We've eaten here a couple of times- love the salsa bar (HARBANARO!!!) and the guac is pretty decent. The sidewalk patio is a great place to hang out in the summer. After living in Tucson for many years, I am always skeptical of Mexican restaurants. That being said, they have the most authentic tacos on Kent. I have only eaten here once, but I will be back. I wish they offered margaritas on the rocks instead of always frozen. The guacamole was great and I love a good salsa and hot sauce bar. I had a quesadilla. It was one of the best i have ever had. The staff was friendly and helpful. The frozen sangria is delicious, but quite strong. The salsa bar was a little underwhelming, but it is more than made up for by everything else. I would recommend highly! I have eaten at Fresco three times. The first two times I didn't have any complaints about the food. The tacos are really good. The last time I ordered take out, the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry. The prices are a little high, but the service is fast. I would eat here again. I asked the girl at the counter what was best. She recommended the pork tacos and I was very happy with them.

The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs.

Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!! OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket.

zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,"This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. The ribs are meaty, tender and juicy.A plus is that around 7pm there's live music. We are looking forward to our next meal. Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!! OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket. Could hardly pick it up with a fork. Owner and crew very nice. We'll definitely be back.:) This barbecue joint certainly has a lot to offer it definitely can compete with any barbecue in town or out of town. IMHO, their brisket is top-shelf and you're not like all you can eat catfish. My personal favorite is white beans I like them just like they make-im. Shane was our server the certainly prettiest helpful I highly recommend the joint Food was terrific and the Spicy barbecue sauce was super yummy. Service was not so great. Took a long time for the waitress to take our order. Luckily we were not in a hurry. Food took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not that busy - only about 8 tables. The best BBQ I have had in a long time! Since living in the South!!!! They know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus... vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb! Glad you are in Chandler! Sadly, was not impressed. Sunday brunch, Ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. Meat was VERY burnt and DRY. I was really wanting to like this place. Potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. Hubby said Brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that.","The BBQ dishes are full of flavor and very tender. They offer numerous dishes, from ribs to brisket, and many side dishes as well. Beans, fries, coleslaw and potato salad are offered and live music usually starts around 7 pm. Some dishes may not be as fresh as they could be, sometimes dry.","This is a great place for great barbecue. The quality of the food is top-notch, and the service is top notch.
