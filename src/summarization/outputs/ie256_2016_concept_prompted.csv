Finally , a few students found F tables and understanding the discrepancies of the various distributions interesting .","In this lecture students were interested in the F distribution, T and F distributions, using the distribution to compare variances, and the usage of different distributions. They were also interested by the distribution tables and graphs."
"Students were mostly confused about F Distribution , Problem session and quiz questions . Some also had trouble with T Distribution , Confidence Interval and Alfa Value , while 27 % of students found everything is clear .","In this lecture students had trouble with the last question in class. They had trouble understanding the T and F distributions, the confidence interval, and the tableau of the F distribution. Some students had problems with the degree of freedom and degrees of freedom."
"The majority of students found Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Interval of Variance mostly interesting , including one-sided interval , two-sided interval and application . Several students also were interested in H0 & H1 parameters , Chi Distribution","In this lecture students enjoyed learning about hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, one-sided intervals, and variance intervals. They also enjoyed the examples of H0 and H1, and the examples used to test hypotheses."
"A little over 1/3 of students had no problems . A handful had issues with chi-squared concepts , and a few struggled with some of the PS questions and degrees of freedom . A couple students did n't understand the study set/quiz answers .","In this lecture students had trouble with the chi-square distribution, degrees of freedom, and the greyscale intensity study set answers. Some students had no problems at all."
"Over half of the students enjoyed T-distributions , and a third liked F-distributions . A few students did n't enjoy anything , and one student each liked comparing variances and sampling distributions .","In this lecture students were mainly interested in the T and F distributions. They were also interested in sampling distributions, the normal distribution, and the F distribution. Some students were confused about how to use the distribution."
"Almost 40 % of students found nothing to be difficult . A handful struggled with lognormal distribution and PS/study set questions -LRB- and their irrelevance , in particular -RRB- . A few students had trouble with one-sided intervals and confidence intervals .","In this lecture students had trouble with confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and the study set questions. They also had trouble understanding the log normal distribution and the one-sided interval problem. Some students had no problems."
"Around one fourth of students found hypothesis testing on Population Variance such as pooled variance mostly interesting . Another 19 % of students were interested in Type 2 Error , and 16 % of students were interested in T Value , T test and T distribution . Several students also found Paired Observation interesting .","Most of the students found paired observations and type 2 error interesting. A few others liked hypothesis testing, pooled variance, and the use of the t distribution."
"About half of students found nothing confusing . A handful still had trouble with mean square error , as well as concepts related to bias -LRB- and unbiased -RRB- . A couple students needed clarification on the project , as well as specific differences in the graphical representation/reliability of mean square vs. bias .","In this lecture students had trouble with the mean square error equation, the bias formula, the sampling distribution, and the homework assignment. Some students also had problems with the graph representation of the bias and the project parts."
"Over a third of students had no problems ; however , another third seemed lost with the last question relating to mean , median , and mode . A small handful did n't understand variance and standard deviation , and a couple students struggled with statistics and probability , as well as r-programming .","Most of the students had trouble understanding the relation between mean and median, and the last part of the lecture. Some of them had trouble with the derivation of the mean/min/max, the difference between the mode and the mean, and determining the standard deviation. A few students had problems with the use of the white board."
"Over half of students had no trouble with the concepts . A handful had issues with mean square error and some of the PS questions . A few are experiencing confusion with bias , and a couple with various estimations .","In this lecture students had trouble with mean square error, bias and unbiased estimations, and the sixth question in the exam. A smaller amount of students had no problems."
"Almost half of students said they enjoyed hypothesis testing . About a quarter liked confidence intervals , and a handful liked confidence intervals for variance or variance intervals . A few students indicated H0 and H1 as their favorites , and a couple pointed out liking the examples .","In this lecture students enjoyed learning about hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, one-sided intervals, and the concept of H0 and H1. They also enjoyed using variance intervals and the examples given in class."
