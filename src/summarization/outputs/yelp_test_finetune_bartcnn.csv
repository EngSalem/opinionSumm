"West Alley BBQ serve great BBQ ribs with spicy sauce. Service is great but may fall below par when there are many customers to attend to. Other dishes include white beans, brisket, fries and potato salad. Features live music in the evening, overall, recommended.","This is a great place for great barbecue. Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans are absolutely amazing. The service is generally good, but sometimes takes a long time to get the food out. The brisket is top-shelf and the beans are just like the way they make them. The fries are good, too, and the slaw on the sand is particularly good. Overall this is a highly recommended place."
"The BBQ dishes are full of flavor and very tender. They offer numerous dishes, from ribs to brisket, and many side dishes as well. Beans, fries, coleslaw and potato salad are offered and live music usually starts around 7 pm. Some dishes may not be as fresh as they could be, sometimes dry.","This is a great place for great barbecue. Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans are absolutely amazing.
