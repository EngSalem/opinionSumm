"This is trendy, upscale Chinese restaurant that sometimes hits a home run of food, but often misses the target when it comes to service. It's in a great location, clean, comfortable, and attractive on the inside. Sometimes, items on the menu are on point and offer generous portions, but other things are overly complex or drenched in too much MSG. The prices are up, and the service is often unreliable as servers can sometimes have an attitude or completely fail at being attentive.","This restaurant is a nice place for dim sum, but the service can be a bit lacking. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends). The food comes out slowly and the service is generally not very attentive or friendly. The price is high, but it is worth it for the quality of the dim sum."

"The overall dining experience at American Gypsy Cafe is excellent. The food is tasty, the portions are generous, and the prices are very reasonable.
