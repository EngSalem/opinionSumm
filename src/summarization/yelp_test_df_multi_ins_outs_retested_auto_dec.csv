gUQXksFGvShjSl7Xil41bQ,"Came here to have my IPAD4 cracked screen fixed and they did a fantastic job and at a really affordable price. Definitely worth a try if you have a need to repair you tablet or phone. Will update if there are any problems but they have a 30 day warranty. I stopped by Mobile Square recently, to replace the battery on my iPhone 6. The staff were professional, knowledgeable, and had the job done in 20 minutes! My phone has been working great. With the 30 day warranty they offer, plus their ridiculously good prices, I couldn't recommend this place enough. Got my iPhone 6 wet on a run, power button didn't work, volume and home button on the fritz, and the phone kept trying to turn off. $30 and 1 hour later, I'm happily posting this from my phone! These guys are the biggest crooks known to man. They fixed my screen with an aftermarket part claiming that was an original part. The resolution on my screen was distorted because of this.My touch screen is not glitching after 3 weeks.DO NOT GO TO THEM. THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!! HORRIBLE SERVICE! These guys were really quick and professional! Was recommended by a friend. Got my Samsung phone fixed in 30 mins and the price was great and service was attentive. They also threw in a case and protector. Now my phone feels great! Would totally recommend and definitely coming back! Unreliable liar. Does not honour what their agreed upon quoted price was. I called them twice confirmed the price to replace a glass screen. After coming in, the price was changed on me. Beware. Do not deal with. Awesome super fast super inexpensive service. I was really impressed. Really professional and nice people. I smashed my iPhone 7 screen to pieces and it came out to $75 after the $5 yelp discount. Pay cash so you don't have to pay tax. 30 day warranty to for any screen response issues. Thanks guys!!! I took my iPad to change what I thought was a dead battery. But they tested it first to make sure it was running properly without selling me something I didn't need. Very professional.

Food was not worth the price for sure. I have been here 20 times and the staff from greater, wait staff, bartenders, managers Have been excellent busy slow always the same great service. Have had orders not made to my request and instantly fixed, mangers always come by asking how everything is. The food is excellent It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch.

Definitely coming back because of him! Keep up the great work Trevor!!!! This location is busy. I was happy with the prompt service and good food. I have visited the other locations in the past 75th McDowell and Estrella parkway and McDowell and this location is by far the the friendliest. Next time I feel like soup and salad without ghetto or cold treatment I will definitely stop at this location. The host, our waitress and the food were all great!

It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!! The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order.

The best pizza place in the Valley just happens to be the first pizza my wife and I went to when we moved out here almost 11 years ago.

i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw,"I love this neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable. Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven. It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!! The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub! Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix. I grew up with Rafaelle's Pizza. One of 2 places from which my family would order. Both places are still in business! The pizza is great and the lunch specials are a fair deal as well!

The food was a bit better than average but nothing to knock your socks off. A good place to go with family or friends.They have a cheese sauce that is a bit spicy but tasty! Great location and atmosphere. Authentic and Mexican American fare that was served in generous portions and DELICIOUS! The Guadalajara burrito was simple and SO flavorful. Hubs had Molcalambres and ranked them near the top of his fajita list. Not hoiity toity; not trying to be hip and trendy like Maize. Will come back whenever in town. Love this place! The waitstaff is great and friendly, they are very quick but also allow you to relax and not feel rushed. I go here in the summer with some friends and we just sit on the patio (great outdoor seating) and drink margaritas and enjoy the complimentary fresh chips and salsa. Also great food! They took a while to bring the food, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla that was very soggy and tasteless, the rest of the food was edible but far from good, place was ok, it's far from the best but if you hungry and desperate you can certainly go eat there. Good food at a great price, the restaurant has become a great lunch destination. The food is basic American-Mexican combinations (burrito, enchilada, tamale for example) with very quick service. Honestly have not been to a sit down restaurant with such speedy service during the lunch rush. Their food is decent, but the reason I'm writing this review is their healthy margarita. It's incredible and I'm not even usually a margarita fan! My husband ordered the regular margarita and we both agreed that the healthy was much better than the regular margarita. Go try it! The first time I went here, I ordered a taco salad with beef, and the beef was pink. Not brown on the outside and pink on the inside, pink pink pink. The second time I went, my friend and I had the same burrito combination platter and both of us got sick the next day. Went here with a group to drink some margaritas and eat some chips and salsa.

I don't have a lot of good things to say about this place except that the food is decent but service is lacking.

The food wasn't cheap, but everything was really unique and pretty good. Service and staff was nice and friendly. I'd say the dim sum is comparable to uptown restaurants.

I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly. Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption. Overall, the depth & complexity of the dim sum left me wanting for dim sum from Richmond Hill instead. I won't be back. Hands down this is my new favorite go to for tasty and healthier Chinese. We tried 10 different dim sum items and they were all excellent and not drenched in oil. The space is quite elegant and the service was above average.

ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w,"Food was strictly ok, I've had way better dimsum. The service was pretty bad - the waiter kept coming by to see if we were done eating starting at 9: 30pm, when the restaurant closes at 10pm. I wouldn't go back. I don't have a lot of good things to say about this place except that the food is decent but service is lacking. This restaurant is relatively new but will not last long if they do not change / improve things. Food is good but service needs to be improved (they are understaffed). We had a great time at Kwan. The food wasn't cheap, but everything was really unique and pretty good. Service and staff was nice and friendly. I'd say the dim sum is comparable to uptown restaurants. This is a good choice if you live in midtown of Toronto. Came here for the first time today for dim sum. I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly. Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption. Overall, the depth & complexity of the dim sum left me wanting for dim sum from Richmond Hill instead. I won't be back. Hands down this is my new favorite go to for tasty and healthier Chinese. We tried 10 different dim sum items and they were all excellent and not drenched in oil. The space is quite elegant and the service was above average. Was feeling under the weather one day at work so I decided to get some congee for takeout. I ordered the congee with century egg and pork for $5. It definitely hit the spot and was a good portion. Would like to return and try the dim sum some day! As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends) .Also be careful to check your bill before you pay.","This dim sum restaurant has mixed results. The food itself is fine, however the service leaves something to be desired. Servers are known for being unfriendly and inattentive. The price is fine, but unless the service improves, the restaurant is not recommended.","This is a nice Chinese restaurant in midtown Toronto.

jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"This is probably my favorite Persian cuisine resturant in Vegas. The place is nicely decorated and very clean. I am very impressed with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab.... Amazing! It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though. Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here.

I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience! Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent. Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself.

For some reason I just think the one on Northern was always better when I was growing up I am an Arizona native I used to love this place. WHAT HAPPENED!!! This place is gross. I ordered the burrito enchilada style Gross! The chips were cold I hate that. The service was fine but the food was horrible. Never going back!!!!!!! I've been twice now. .once at lunch and once at happy hour... service is terrible. At 1130 we waited for 10 min before being acknowledged and brought to a take. Hh we waited for drinks we waited for food.","The service was pretty okay, but the food was awful and not actually very hot. The chicken taco is full of lettuce and stuffed with lettuce with hardly any meat. The burrito enchilada style was gross and the chips were cold. Super helpful with whatever questions and the bartender was great too. The prices were reasonable and the portions generous.","Great service, reasonable prices, and generous portions. What more could you ask for? How about good food! The food can be a bit pricey, but the portions are generous and the quality of the food is generally good. The staff is generally friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always doing something. Overall, this place is recommended.","This place used to be good. It had a great atmosphere that would be great for families. The staff was friendly and helpful with any questions I had. The food was good, but the quality of the food can be a bit off. The service was okay, but nothing to write home about. Overall, this place is not recommended.","This place used to be good. It had a great atmosphere that would be great for families.

k9RUMKASTB6QZ-NkfnN8Fg,"Go for drinks and the great view but not for the food. The scallops were tasty but heirloom tomatoes and burrata had little flavor. Skip the underdone bruschetta. It was cold and prosciutto had an unexpected sweet taste. The waitress was nice and didn't charge us for the uneaten appetizer. Nice drink menu with reasonably priced wine. What can I say, Eno Vino is one of my top 5 in Madtown. The small plates are better than full meals at some places, and of course the wine selection is outstanding. But probably the most significant draw that really puts the icing on the cake is the location and VIEW. Great photo ops and ambience for a nice Barolo and bruschetta plate. This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing. Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them. Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro! Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby. I live the original Eno vino way better in term of serving speed and quality of services including the way cheeseboard is not being served with wood board here in downtown location. Foods are still good. But table is small. AC is not strong. And very very noisy","Eno Vino bar is renowned for excellent drinks and an impressive view of the Capital worth experiencing.

I would say prices are the middle of the road. It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend! Had a good experience at the Wexford location. We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back! Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat. So disappointed!

keJGpYownJ-j2zQJ5huvqg,"Pretty cool bar and a neat area of town. Off the beaten path of regular tourist attractions. Place has been around for a long time and the Mac n Cheese options are plentiful and pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere and good service. We hiked up [what felt like] a bazillion hills to get here and I can't be upset about it because everything was so good. It was Saturday brunch and we had the mimosas, which seemed heavy on the champagne so no complaints. Everyone loved every item they ordered. Good local hang out! The staff can be hit or miss but the food is always good.My favorites are the fried pickles and the grilled cheese burger. It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold. Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous. Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot! Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch. What a great local bar / restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night.

Wish we had one in Nashville...... in my Street.... in my House. Best gelato, so creamy and full of flavor! The cheesecake gelato tastes like actual cheesecake! And you can sample every flavor if you want! The creamy cookie is also delicious! A perfect treat for a hot Arizona day! I can't wait to come back! Yes! Real, creamy, flavorful gelato. The best I've had. I had peanut butter with a little scoop of banana recommended by the owner. My husband had champagne with a little chocolate. This will be our new place. Goodbye Gelato Spot. The best Gelato! I always go with my family and recommend my clients here. The shop is super cute inside and the owners are so nice and welcoming All the time. You can try samples which makes it hard cause they are all so good! Highly recommended!! My 9 year old son and I tried Pussycat Gelato for the 1st time. The gelato was amazing and we would return from ahwatukee again. The partners who own the shop were generous in telling us all about the gelato and providing numerous samples. When my 9 year old couldn't decide what flavor, the owner allowed him to have 4 flavors in his cup. This place was fantastic! The flavors were both fresh and intense. The young man that waited on us was so pleasant and friendly. I eat ice cream every single day and I can honestly tell you that this is the best ice cream / gelato / yogurt total experience I have ever had. Don't miss a visit here. The name caught our eye and the posters on the wall. Hahaha. The guys working were so friendly! And their gelato is delicious and they had some unique flavors. I ended up with the espresso toffee dream and the double chocolate. It was sooooo good! Esp the espresso toffee! It was so flavorful yet not overpowering. Prices are reasonable too!

mBeZ3dQzUPV60Oa26k3qHw,"I agree with many of the other reviews! Harkins has great customer service, I love the loyalty cup.This location is nice, good parking, chairs and everything still comfortable. Great popcorn, they have Dr. Pepper (my fave). Godzilla was awesome, this Harkins Theaters was very busy, more than normal or maybe because its the weekend. Either way we enjoyed our movie and the staffs are friendly and theater was very clean and well taken care of. No trash on the floor and everything was just great. Like I mentioned before.... Very clean well kept place. Went back and they made my salt free popcorn with a smile and no hair! Managers contacted me and made sure to ask employees to pull hair back. Definitely the cleanest theater in town. Love this theatre it's ALWAYS clean and is never packed. Unlike Harkins Gateway on 99th Ave and McDowell which always is over crowded with people. Great places to shop and eat after or before a movie. I would recommend this theatre to anybody. Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time. Nice way to get more for your dollar. I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time.

Harkins has great customer service, I love the loyalty cup.This location is nice, good parking, chairs and everything still comfortable. Great popcorn, they have Dr. Pepper (my fave). Godzilla was awesome, this Harkins Theaters was very busy, more than normal or maybe because its the weekend. Either way we enjoyed our movie and the staffs are friendly and theater was very clean and well taken care of. No trash on the floor and everything was just great. Like I mentioned before.... Very clean well kept place. Went back and they made my salt free popcorn with a smile and no hair! Managers contacted me and made sure to ask employees to pull hair back. Definitely the cleanest theater in town. Love this theatre it's ALWAYS clean and is never packed. Unlike Harkins Gateway on 99th Ave and McDowell which always is over crowded with people. Great places to shop and eat after or before a movie. I would recommend this theatre to anybody. Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time. Nice way to get more for your dollar. I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience Love it here there's always plenty of room Harkins Theatres and lots of things to do in this little shopping plaza, there's lots of good food a lots of good shopping around here all the family and kids living around here it's nice Harkins is an amazing company.

mSibSn9jCe8zKNyPOhyysg,"Came here at 11: 30 am first, I just couldn't handle the smell. And asked to use the grill for all you can eat. Apparently they don't do all you can eat around that time. I'm disappointed Never coming back to this restaurant again! The staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. My husband found a hair in his food and the manager didn't want to re-make his order nor give him a refund. Stay away from this restaurant! Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw. Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ. Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right. Side dishes are average. Takamatsu was way better. No kimbap. Probably won't be back. This place is pretty good. There are not a lot of Korean BBQ spots in Arizona that actually have grills. We sat in a nice booth and the table had a grill. The side dishes are not as good as other places. The meats were delicious. Overall we enjoyed this place and will be going back. My first time to this place and it was so delicious. The Siracha Honey Pork Shoulder was our absolute favorite! Such unique food and a unique experience. We are stuffed! The prices are super reasonable and the flavor is superb. We will definitely be back. This will become the newest hottest spot in the east valley! Food is amazing, ambiance is very nice, workers are so pleasant, very nice hangout place! Come and try their bbq or try their restaurant menu. You won't be disappointed! Never coming back to this place because we waited for 1 hour for food only to tell us that our order was never in! Lol. This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here! Great service! I liked it when it was Takamatsu, but now they are Arirang, all the ban chan were fresher, the server took the time to get to know us, and unlike the last few visits when it was still Takamatsu, they weren't out of a single item we ordered!

mhMhYsmJB4t0-ok1ABvNBg,"Awesome place. The bar is sleak and clean, the staff is friendly, the draft beer selection is glorious, their craft cocktails are delicious, and hell they even have good food. Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out! What a great new beer and wine bar! We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap... thanks for the great recommendation! Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio. Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall. I will definitely come back! Was recommended to this place by a friend. I was immediately impressed by the depth and breadth of the drink selection. Then the food came out... I was blown away!! It was incredible! I definitely recommend this place to anyone participating in exploring local restaurants and finding out the hidden gems that are right around the corner. Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly! Try it. Seriously, try it- the neighborhood is completely turned around. Recently moved nearby, and was so happy I stopped in! Great beer selection that rotates often, so make sure you buy a growler to go if you love what you're drinking, chances are others are loving it too! Sliders are bombbbb Im new to the area to I went to this place to eat tonight, no one welcomed me I had to ask for a menu and a seat.

mhMhYsmJB4t0-ok1ABvNBg,"Awesome place. The bar is sleak and clean, the staff is friendly, the draft beer selection is glorious, their craft cocktails are delicious, and hell they even have good food. Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out! What a great new beer and wine bar! We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap... thanks for the great recommendation! Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio. Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall. I will definitely come back! Was recommended to this place by a friend. I was immediately impressed by the depth and breadth of the drink selection. Then the food came out... I was blown away!! It was incredible! I definitely recommend this place to anyone participating in exploring local restaurants and finding out the hidden gems that are right around the corner. Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly! Try it. Seriously, try it- the neighborhood is completely turned around. Recently moved nearby, and was so happy I stopped in! Great beer selection that rotates often, so make sure you buy a growler to go if you love what you're drinking, chances are others are loving it too! Sliders are bombbbb Im new to the area to I went to this place to eat tonight, no one welcomed me I had to ask for a menu and a seat. I was never asked if I wanted anything to drink nor was I asked anything so I left. I would not recommend this place if you want any good service. Super cute! It has a stainless steal look / appearance to it. Small location, tucked away in a mini business strip. Parking can be a challenge as it is in a small plaza, although I have not encountered not being able to find a parking spot. It has a neighborhood feel to it, with friendly staff.","This bar / restaurant has an impressive wine a beer selection. The beer selection in particular is wide-ranging and changes regularly. The food is also very good. The service is friendly. The decor has a pseudo-industrial stainless steel look, and the atmosphere is pretty laid back.

Ended up having to go back up and tell them we needed to change it to go. Spent 20 minutes inside just to come out with a bag of food to eat in the car. This place is awesome! They have added breakfast and a Freestyle Coke Machine! There are so many choices and things to try. I love the drive thru and the inside is very comfortable and clean.

nm9aJr7qQadbkTP6lnXB1Q,"Have gone here for over ten years. Great customers and good food. However, constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, replacing the old with the new doesn't always work. Wings were amazing. Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them. Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this 'our place'. Closed. Sad but true Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting. Service is 'OK'. Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way. If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!! I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious. I also love their Wing Wednesday deal. 79 cent wings and they have @ 6 flavors. Plus they give you choice of fried or grilled. Awesome!","A bar that has been a mainstay in the area for many years.

I had the garlic stir fry with tofu and brown rice and it was very good. They even got it right when I asked for no mushrooms or water chestnuts. THE BEST Asian Bistro in all of Charlotte!!!! LOVE this place! I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere! As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for. It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks.

They have everything from Pad Thai to Vietnamese, to fresh fish! My favorite is really the sushi, such great food... a must when you are in Charlotte! We went here on a nice night for dinner so we were able to sit outside, which was nice.The food was excellent. We ordered three types of rolls and they were all delicious.

oAq3-dXyDT3k4Mluc1ftTA,"nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation! Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure. One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality. I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)! The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again. Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass. Plenty of better options in the area. Will not be going back to this place. I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups! I had the ribeye steak combo medium rare. It was so soft and buttery and just so good!! The server was so nice and it was just a good time! got there around 2 during the lunch hours and there was no wait time. Very good food! Very entertaining show!","This restaurant provides average quality food for reasonable prices considering the location. The teppenyaki is an especially popular choice.

oAq3-dXyDT3k4Mluc1ftTA,"nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation! Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure. One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality. I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)! The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again. Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass.

oDM09XMN-FG0ii_gdVMrTw,"Pretty sure if you've been to one little Caesars pizza you been to them all I have no complaints about this store every time I order I'm in and out quick. They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lol This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8, blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it. Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere... This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.. Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait... Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies. 0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again.

oM6TsEcgj4i9McivZnu5EA,"Honey did an amazing job! Sweet girl love my fall nails. She didn't hurt me which is what usually scares me. The last time I came in the girl had cut me.... but I loved my appointment this time! Go see her. first time here. not bad for a list bit of me time, and a quick polish change. Prices are compatible to other nail salons in the area, and its right next door to a Sally's Beauty Supply were you can pick up a nice bottle of bottle of polish for touch ups. I was in the area and called to see if they do walk-ins. They took me right in! Very clean and nice looking nail salon. I will definitely come back and get pedicure done again. Thanks Kim for doing a good job! Hadn't been in here in over a year because we had moved. Came back and it was just as clean and friendly. Had a great relaxing pedicure. Reasonably priced and they didn't rush through anything. Hope I'm back in the area next time I'm in need of a pedi. Pretty Cool place for toe up keep. I get my feet handled and taken care of and my gal gets both toes and hands taken care of here. small, funny Asian girl is funny and kinda a smart ass but makes waiting funny and hearing her talk lol. Fastest fill ever! I walked in expecting to be there at least an hour, but to my surprise was out in half the time. Kate did a very through job and gave me exactly what I wanted. I'm pretty picky with nail quality and shape and she did a wonderful job. I will definitely be coming here from now on.:) I'm sure glad that I didn't listen to the previous reviews. Tom did my nails and he did absolutely perfect with them! I will be returning Update: a year later and I still love this place! They never disappoint and Kim is the best! She always helps me get exactly what I want. The salon is the best! I actually loved this place, It wasn't bad at all. The guy who did my pedicure did such a wonderful job... Best pedicure I've ever had, and I always go to different places trying to find a good place to go. But after coming here, I think I found my permanent place:)","A very clean and beautiful salon.

Making sure everyone was satisfied and checking on his employees. Definitely my new nail place! I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it!

Be sure to ask for almond milk if you are vegan:) The barista was so kind to change it out for my friend and I as we forgot to ask about other milk alternatives. Great idea and they use Averys roastery for their coffee! That means the coffee is yummy! The customer service is great! They just need to grow a little! Support them, they deserve it! I highly recommend an AEROPRESS! Love finding local gems like this! Really cute space, stage for open mic nights, an incredible amount of board games, and really creative drink menu. The barista was so kind and friendly, giving us drink recommendations that we loved. I had the bath bomb iced tea and it was very unique and tasty. Cam in the other day and was pleasantly surprised! Really cute and rooms of fun looking games. Ordered espresso on ice and jazzed it up a bit. Really good espresso. Took my kiddo a cookie and it was amazing! Owner was working and recommended it. I'll be back for sure. This is one my family's favorite chill spots. Jupiter and RJ are always so friendly and helpful. So clutch with the drinks; Emilio, Arnold Schwarzen-Palmer, and PO Double G are legit!!!

I've been happy with the results each time and will continue to use this groomer. The staff and the owner are among the nicest people ever! My dog Mindy had her first grooming here since moving to Arizona. Everyone seemed very professional and Mindy looks great. I like the fact that they are kennel free. Rather opting to have pens with beds for each pet. The salon is very clean and the pricing is right where it should be. I'll be taking my dog there again! We were 19 minutes late to our appointment and they told us they wouldn't take our dogs for their appointment. Oh well, at $85 per dog, we are fine with taking our business elsewhere. They never seem to remember us or our dogs whenever we come in anyway. We pretty much feel like we are just a number. We take our 3 year old yellow lab in (Kona) for a shave and nail grinding. He looks amazing when they are done! He LOVES going there and everyone who works there is so nice and friendly! The facility is very clean. Their pricing is comparable to other places, but we know our dog is in good hands when he goes there! Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner. We've been loyal customers since it opened. Our cavalier always looks amazing after being groomed here. I love that they also have a do-it-yourself pet-bath option. The staff always listens and is helpful. Very clean facility too. I brought in my two Pugs here and they loved it! They were pampered and walked out of there smelling good and clean. Of course, that didn't last long because those two love to get dirty. Furry Beginnings is a great place to bring your fur baby. The staff is amazing and very caring! You'll love this place! Best groomer in Gilbert. The owners love dogs and people! The grooming is reasonable in price and the dog wash is fun for people and dogs too. They have great staff and a good selection of leashes, collars and other dog lover items. We always get great treatment for our two yorkies from Darcy. She is great and really cares about our spoiled little girls. We moved a bit farther away and still value and trust them with our doggies that we don't even think about taking them anywhere else. We are always thrilled with their looks and the way we are treated!","The staff is very friendly and their skill is great. The staff always listens to what the customer needs.

I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!! I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry!

But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here. Staff is always awesomely happy and helpful. This is my favorite Joe's.

pLPV7vybH3FMnT-Um7IQhQ,"I'm so glad to find a place that makes delicious Appletinis. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol. Your cheesy fries and pretzel with cheese is good as well. The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes. I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight! Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored. This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well. Very impressed. Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome!!!! Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!! I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment. I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend. The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots. Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well. But it was hot and tasted fresh. I was informed that if I wanted the condiments that I would have to come to the restaurant myself to get them.","The appletinis and the appetizers were good and delicious.

The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes. I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight! Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored. This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well. Very impressed. Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome!!!! Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!! I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment. I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend. The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food.

qSa3L7cy8Gju4ZLs50ycag,"This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy. Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant! The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back. It's like eating watered down butter with oysters incorporated into it. Highly highly highly recommend CAPTAIN D's;) I am NOT a shellfish fan but the seafood here is really good along w / the hushpuppies! Was recommended by a person I work with and I am glad I went--and have gone several times since then. Just be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line. I don't eat seafood, but they have great chicken and steak for anyone who doesn't like seafood! The place looks very cool on the inside as if you are at the beach. The hush puppies are to die for!! I had the filet of perch and fried oysters and man... They were great! Great portion size for 14 bucks. Even though I got fried it wasn't greasy. I got it to go but the place looked pretty cool to eat at! The fries and hush puppies were good. I will return. It's been awhile since I have been here, but the crab legs were always fantastic. Family friendly restaurant with the best service. The complimentary hushpuppies are delicous and fresh. If you want good home cooking and delish seafood or fish, I will always recommend this place!

They are great with kids and very flexible about menu substitutions. Try some specials instead of the all-you-can-eat, I recommend the torched sushi! Subpar sushi, but good serving sizes for the price we paid. Took a while for service to come to us, even after asking several times. Ordered a Coke, and it didn't come until we asked again. But it's sushi, and sushi is good. I like this restaurant and I'm regular comustomer.Every time I go there I gave the tip over the% 15 but i won't give them a tip anymore.I knew that the servers can't get the tip.Their wage is just $12- $14 / hour including a tip.It was shocked.You don't need to give the tip for servers. Not the greatest sushi option around this area. The restaurant looked dated, and the food was not the best. I ended up feeling a little sick after eating here. I mostly ate sashimi, so maybe the fish was not in its best condition, or was not fresh enough.","While this spot isn't the best of sushi places around, the prices are reasonable and the customer service is very good.

If you like rude incompetent employees, almost an hour long wait for just picking up a phone order, and basically being treated like a second class citizen then look no further than Bennett Medical. DON'T use this medical supply. Never enough staff to answer phone, so you'll need to leave messages. No return phone calls. I am unable to get my CPAP supplies every quarter without hours of calling / waiting / calling. Poor customer service. Will be moving to another medical supply as soon as I can. Terrible experience. They have ridiculous price also bad customer services. You can get nebulizer machine around $50 at amazon, bennet medical charge you almost twice more expensive price. And breathing kit price was unbelievable too. Because of deduction, I had to pay them all out of my pocket whatever they charged. I don't recommand this medical company to anyone. Good luck getting a phone call back or someone to answer the phone without hanging up immediately.

I could barely find the Tako in the takoyaki. I am sorry to say that Musashi is still my go to for Japanese food. This place was absolutely amazing!! I had the tonkotsu miso ramen and ended up finishing the whole thing. The flavor was so good and that egg... mmm! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I am so happy I found this place! love the authenticity of this place! takoyaki, ramen, gyoza so delicious and flavor is spot-on. pricey but the politeness and friendliness of the staff outshines. i have taken friends here to eat and they love it, family loves it too. portion is large, you will go home very full and happy.

I would drink the broth by the gallon if I could. I can't go a few days without going back. Love this place!!! I had the coconut Thia ramen and my whole table tried to steal it from me-so good.

Took a two hour drive from Raleigh to try this place. Owner is from SF and worked at SF Japan town ramen place before. The soup base is the real stuff, not fake powders like other places. Will come back again for sure. Awesome ramen. We tried the Shio ramen and miso ramen; both were made very well. Agedashii tofu and pork curry bowls were equally tasty.

y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"We just had lunch here and it was excellent. Tony is our waiter and he is absolutely amazing! Very helpful, recommended lots of great dishes and extremely attentive. Our food was delicious, dim sum were all very fresh and the wines were great too. Would thoroughly recommend. Dim sum was on point! Service was ridiculously slow. Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for. Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip. We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns! I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent! The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast. We liked it enough to return the next day. It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area. Also, parking is very easy and free. This place is okay for dim sum. It was not too pricey and locals get a discount so make sure to ask for the locals discount. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I'm on the strip and in the mood for dim sum it's worth trying. Overall it was really fine. Awesome selection of dim sum for lunch, service is fast and friendly. Seems like I'm there everyday having lunch. Dinner service is equalling great from authentic Chinese dishes to live seafood you can pick right from the wall of tanks. If you like hot tea don't forget to ask for their wide variety and enjoy!!!","Lunch and dinner service is fast, friendly, and excellent. The dim sum was good and freshly made.

First Porsche e hybrid I have had .Great car...... modern car tech at its bestGreat experience .I look forward to many more deals with them.Kevin Campbell one of the best salespeople I have experienced in 40 years of buying cars .Bravo Kevin!! Family has purchased a total of 3 purchases within the last 10 years here and the service has been more than excellent. We had an issue with one of the cars, and they fixed it and allowed us to drive a newer model while ours was in repair. This was my first experience at Porsche North Scottsdale and couldn't have been better. Kevin was clear in his explanations and communicated as he said he would. I am very happy with the Macan I bought even having had one service experience to install window tinting. Got taken with efficiency, no waiting, car ready on time. Great customer service all around. Excellent dealership that Prides itself on service and attentiveness. No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman. The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better. I have come to expect more from a Penske company. Just bought a Porsche Panamera s and absolutely love the car! I wish I would have bought one sooner. Owned high end Lexus, Audi, BMW and Mercedes and I like this car best.Got a fair deal and the sale consultant Mark Siffert made it easy and painless. Overall an excellent experience! The best customer service ever! My son wanted the experience of riding in a 911 Turbo. We had the nicest salesman, named Nick, took us for a one of a kind test drive and made my son's day!

Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well. Goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. Three stars because the food was edible. Ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. The three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. It's okay, but not great. This place is very delicious. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the California burrito and they were all very delicious. The horchata and jaimaca are also very good! I definitely recommend this place, don't ever go back to Roberto's! Food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans.

Some of the items on the menu are good, while others are not so great. The staff is generally friendly, but can be a bit lacking in customer service. The restaurant also has a pinesol cleaner smell, which can overpower the taste of food.

zJzkL4VHHksVVGepR1IAGw,"I do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary. I wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food. What does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini. Food here is really good however I will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them. Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing. My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit. Halifax donair all the way. Back room for a reso is a must. Great space for a 8 - 12 person party. Didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. Same goes for the scallops. The Notorious PIG was a hit with our group. Went to have brunch for Mother's Day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! Had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! The toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy! I'm excited to go back for dinner! Sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious hopgoods foodliner delivers exactly what I'm after: flavour! And lots of it. Service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's liking.Sweetbreads, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and Donairs are what we tried. 4.5 stars! The food was delicious! The wait staff really friendly and attentive. Probably some of the best I've ever had. We tried the crispy pig ear salad, oysters, donairs, Lobster Spaghetti, Cauliflower clams and crispy toffee for desert. I would definitely not leave without trying the Lobster Spaghetti.","The food at this restaurant is generally well-liked. Most of the food is very good, though some items might only be considered OK.

zSQs_cDOOyjnTHREy9yRfQ,"This place was ok. You can't go wrong with a variety of salsas. My burrito was good, but the rice inside lacked flavor. I was left with a mouth full of bland flavoring and had to constantly add sauces and salsa to every bite to give it taste. Price wasn't bad. Portions were nice. Just lacking in flavor and taste. i ordered the water street with chicken. i got the water street with beef. the manager quickly fixed my order. fantastic customer service. 5 stars. follow up. my second burrito got me sick. the rice was hard and there was hardly any chicken or fillings. i have food poisoning, and i will not return to this restaurant.beware! Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself.Was a little confused about the ordering system. The prices are also a little much but the food was very good. Had the grilled fish tacos and the queso and they were both wonderful! Highly recommend if you're looking to get away from Chipotle or Taco Bell. This is a nice spot that offers gluten free options. We've eaten here a couple of times- love the salsa bar (HARBANARO!!!) and the guac is pretty decent. The sidewalk patio is a great place to hang out in the summer. After living in Tucson for many years, I am always skeptical of Mexican restaurants. That being said, they have the most authentic tacos on Kent. I have only eaten here once, but I will be back. I wish they offered margaritas on the rocks instead of always frozen. The guacamole was great and I love a good salsa and hot sauce bar. I had a quesadilla. It was one of the best i have ever had. The staff was friendly and helpful. The frozen sangria is delicious, but quite strong. The salsa bar was a little underwhelming, but it is more than made up for by everything else. I would recommend highly! I have eaten at Fresco three times. The first two times I didn't have any complaints about the food. The tacos are really good. The last time I ordered take out, the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry. The prices are a little high, but the service is fast. I would eat here again. I asked the girl at the counter what was best. She recommended the pork tacos and I was very happy with them. The salsa bar is a cute gimmick, but I'd rather have one really good salsa than ten mediocre ones.","This place has a salsa bar that features a wide variety of different salsas that are very good, and also features a very good guacamole.

zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,"This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. The ribs are meaty, tender and juicy.A plus is that around 7pm there's live music. We are looking forward to our next meal. Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!! OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket. Could hardly pick it up with a fork. Owner and crew very nice. We'll definitely be back.:) This barbecue joint certainly has a lot to offer it definitely can compete with any barbecue in town or out of town. IMHO, their brisket is top-shelf and you're not like all you can eat catfish. My personal favorite is white beans I like them just like they make-im. Shane was our server the certainly prettiest helpful I highly recommend the joint Food was terrific and the Spicy barbecue sauce was super yummy. Service was not so great. Took a long time for the waitress to take our order. Luckily we were not in a hurry. Food took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not that busy - only about 8 tables. The best BBQ I have had in a long time! Since living in the South!!!! They know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus... vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb! Glad you are in Chandler! Sadly, was not impressed. Sunday brunch, Ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. Meat was VERY burnt and DRY. I was really wanting to like this place. Potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. Hubby said Brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that.","The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender. However, it might be wise to avoid Sunday brunch as the food tends to be dry and burnt.","This is a great place for great barbecue. The quality of the food is top-notch, and the service is always top notch. The staff is always very courteous and helpful. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat.

zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,"This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. The ribs are meaty, tender and juicy.A plus is that around 7pm there's live music. We are looking forward to our next meal. Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!! OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket. Could hardly pick it up with a fork. Owner and crew very nice.
