gUQXksFGvShjSl7Xil41bQ,"Came here to have my IPAD4 cracked screen fixed and they did a fantastic job and at a really affordable price. Definitely worth a try if you have a need to repair you tablet or phone. Will update if there are any problems but they have a 30 day warranty. I stopped by Mobile Square recently, to replace the battery on my iPhone 6. The staff were professional, knowledgeable, and had the job done in 20 minutes! My phone has been working great. With the 30 day warranty they offer, plus their ridiculously good prices, I couldn't recommend this place enough. Got my iPhone 6 wet on a run, power button didn't work, volume and home button on the fritz, and the phone kept trying to turn off. $30 and 1 hour later, I'm happily posting this from my phone! These guys are the biggest crooks known to man. They fixed my screen with an aftermarket part claiming that was an original part. The resolution on my screen was distorted because of this.My touch screen is not glitching after 3 weeks.DO NOT GO TO THEM. THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!! HORRIBLE SERVICE! These guys were really quick and professional! Was recommended by a friend. Got my Samsung phone fixed in 30 mins and the price was great and service was attentive. They also threw in a case and protector. Now my phone feels great! Would totally recommend and definitely coming back! Unreliable liar. Does not honour what their agreed upon quoted price was. I called them twice confirmed the price to replace a glass screen. After coming in, the price was changed on me. Beware. Do not deal with. Awesome super fast super inexpensive service. I was really impressed. Really professional and nice people. I smashed my iPhone 7 screen to pieces and it came out to $75 after the $5 yelp discount. Pay cash so you don't have to pay tax. 30 day warranty to for any screen response issues. Thanks guys!!! I took my iPad to change what I thought was a dead battery.

i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw,"I love this neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable. Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven. It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!! The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub! Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix. I grew up with Rafaelle's Pizza. One of 2 places from which my family would order. Both places are still in business! The pizza is great and the lunch specials are a fair deal as well! Still consistently great after 30 years! I really love the Sicilian pizza here. This pizza is perfect for 5-6 people.The New York style pizza here is also very good. You can't beat it in Phoenix.

i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw,"I love this neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable. Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven. It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy. Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!! The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub! Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix. I grew up with Rafaelle's Pizza. One of 2 places from which my family would order. Both places are still in business! The pizza is great and the lunch specials are a fair deal as well! Still consistently great after 30 years! I really love the Sicilian pizza here. This pizza is perfect for 5-6 people.The New York style pizza here is also very good. You can't beat it in Phoenix. This pizza reminds me of living back East. I don't have a picture. I ate it all. The best pizza place in the Valley just happens to be the first pizza my wife and I went to when we moved out here almost 11 years ago. The pizza is straightforward and delicious, the wings are sneaky good and the staff is great. If you're in the area, stop in - you won't regret it! Soooooo good.. the guys there friendly as anyone and the food is awesome... this is the type of place I envision taking up a corner in Brooklyn... a little shady but that pie is amazing!!!! Very good guys... will be back!!!!","The best pizza place in Phoenix.The pizza is perfection, with a crispy crust, delicious sauce and plenty of cheese. Pizza is sold either as a whole pie or by the slice. Wings, mozzarella sticks and subs are also on the menu as just as tasty at the pizza.

The food was a bit better than average but nothing to knock your socks off. A good place to go with family or friends.They have a cheese sauce that is a bit spicy but tasty! Great location and atmosphere. Authentic and Mexican American fare that was served in generous portions and DELICIOUS! The Guadalajara burrito was simple and SO flavorful. Hubs had Molcalambres and ranked them near the top of his fajita list. Not hoiity toity; not trying to be hip and trendy like Maize. Will come back whenever in town. Love this place! The waitstaff is great and friendly, they are very quick but also allow you to relax and not feel rushed. I go here in the summer with some friends and we just sit on the patio (great outdoor seating) and drink margaritas and enjoy the complimentary fresh chips and salsa. Also great food! They took a while to bring the food, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla that was very soggy and tasteless, the rest of the food was edible but far from good, place was ok, it's far from the best but if you hungry and desperate you can certainly go eat there. Good food at a great price, the restaurant has become a great lunch destination. The food is basic American-Mexican combinations (burrito, enchilada, tamale for example) with very quick service. Honestly have not been to a sit down restaurant with such speedy service during the lunch rush. Their food is decent, but the reason I'm writing this review is their healthy margarita. It's incredible and I'm not even usually a margarita fan! My husband ordered the regular margarita and we both agreed that the healthy was much better than the regular margarita. Go try it!

The second time I went, my friend and I had the same burrito combination platter and both of us got sick the next day. Went here with a group to drink some margaritas and eat some chips and salsa.

I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly. Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption.

Was feeling under the weather one day at work so I decided to get some congee for takeout. I ordered the congee with century egg and pork for $5. It definitely hit the spot and was a good portion. Would like to return and try the dim sum some day! As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends) .Also be careful to check your bill before you pay.","This dim sum restaurant has mixed results. The food itself is fine, however the service leaves something to be desired. Servers are known for being unfriendly and inattentive. The price is fine, but unless the service improves, the restaurant is not recommended.","This restaurant is relatively new and is very well-regarded for its quality of food and service. The dim sum is good, but the service is below average. The waiters are understaffed and the service can be a bit of a let down. The food is also a bit overpriced, but it is worth the price to get a good portion of dim sum. Overall, the quality of the food is good but the quality is below par.

jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA,"This is probably my favorite Persian cuisine resturant in Vegas. The place is nicely decorated and very clean. I am very impressed with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab.... Amazing! It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though. Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here. The family platter we got was sooo good, would definitely return! I also really liked the sour milk yogurt drink they have here. If you are looking for great Iranian (Persian) or Mediterranean food this is the place to go! They have the best food and the greatest customer service. If you are in Vegas stop by this place, don't miss out on it! I am very excited that I found this restaurant. They offer a very good lunch special menu with good prices for generous portions of delicious food. I plan on returning often. The beef koobideh kabob was succulent and the side salad was refreshingly bright. I highly recommend American Gypsy Cafe. I stop by for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in Vegas. I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience! Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent. Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself. Falafel appetizer and hummus are great starters and the beef koobideh kabobs are great. My friend had the chicken koobideh kabob and loved it. Lunch specials have great deals too. I saw ants in the kitchen area on the way to bathroom. Do not eat here!!! Omg unsanitary. Be aware!! I canceled my order and left asap. You could get staph infection from ants and other bugs.

k9RUMKASTB6QZ-NkfnN8Fg,"Go for drinks and the great view but not for the food. The scallops were tasty but heirloom tomatoes and burrata had little flavor. Skip the underdone bruschetta. It was cold and prosciutto had an unexpected sweet taste. The waitress was nice and didn't charge us for the uneaten appetizer. Nice drink menu with reasonably priced wine. What can I say, Eno Vino is one of my top 5 in Madtown. The small plates are better than full meals at some places, and of course the wine selection is outstanding. But probably the most significant draw that really puts the icing on the cake is the location and VIEW. Great photo ops and ambience for a nice Barolo and bruschetta plate. This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing. Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them. Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro! Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby.

I would say prices are the middle of the road. It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend! Had a good experience at the Wexford location. We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back! Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat. So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened. This place is always delicious. The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours.

Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!!

Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot! Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch. What a great local bar / restaurant.

It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold. Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous. Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot! Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch. What a great local bar / restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night.

Wish we had one in Nashville...... in my Street.... in my House. Best gelato, so creamy and full of flavor! The cheesecake gelato tastes like actual cheesecake! And you can sample every flavor if you want! The creamy cookie is also delicious! A perfect treat for a hot Arizona day! I can't wait to come back! Yes! Real, creamy, flavorful gelato. The best I've had. I had peanut butter with a little scoop of banana recommended by the owner. My husband had champagne with a little chocolate. This will be our new place. Goodbye Gelato Spot. The best Gelato! I always go with my family and recommend my clients here. The shop is super cute inside and the owners are so nice and welcoming All the time. You can try samples which makes it hard cause they are all so good! Highly recommended!! My 9 year old son and I tried Pussycat Gelato for the 1st time. The gelato was amazing and we would return from ahwatukee again. The partners who own the shop were generous in telling us all about the gelato and providing numerous samples. When my 9 year old couldn't decide what flavor, the owner allowed him to have 4 flavors in his cup. This place was fantastic! The flavors were both fresh and intense. The young man that waited on us was so pleasant and friendly. I eat ice cream every single day and I can honestly tell you that this is the best ice cream / gelato / yogurt total experience I have ever had. Don't miss a visit here. The name caught our eye and the posters on the wall. Hahaha. The guys working were so friendly! And their gelato is delicious and they had some unique flavors. I ended up with the espresso toffee dream and the double chocolate. It was sooooo good! Esp the espresso toffee! It was so flavorful yet not overpowering. Prices are reasonable too!

I'm disappointed Never coming back to this restaurant again! The staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. My husband found a hair in his food and the manager didn't want to re-make his order nor give him a refund. Stay away from this restaurant! Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw. Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ. Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right. Side dishes are average. Takamatsu was way better. No kimbap. Probably won't be back. This place is pretty good. There are not a lot of Korean BBQ spots in Arizona that actually have grills. We sat in a nice booth and the table had a grill. The side dishes are not as good as other places. The meats were delicious. Overall we enjoyed this place and will be going back. My first time to this place and it was so delicious. The Siracha Honey Pork Shoulder was our absolute favorite! Such unique food and a unique experience. We are stuffed! The prices are super reasonable and the flavor is superb. We will definitely be back. This will become the newest hottest spot in the east valley! Food is amazing, ambiance is very nice, workers are so pleasant, very nice hangout place! Come and try their bbq or try their restaurant menu. You won't be disappointed! Never coming back to this place because we waited for 1 hour for food only to tell us that our order was never in! Lol. This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here! Great service!

Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out! What a great new beer and wine bar! We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap... thanks for the great recommendation! Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio. Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall. I will definitely come back! Was recommended to this place by a friend. I was immediately impressed by the depth and breadth of the drink selection. Then the food came out... I was blown away!! It was incredible! I definitely recommend this place to anyone participating in exploring local restaurants and finding out the hidden gems that are right around the corner. Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly!

Even after weeks my nails look and feel as good as they did when I first got them done! I'm so dedicated I recommend and bring in all my friends! Definitely my new nail salon! Everyone is so friendly and kind, I felt so welcomed! B did an amazing job on my nails. He made sure everything was perfect and happily changed something to make me happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants A + work at a totally affordable price. Love it!!:) Amazing service and nails. This is the second time I have been here, they did a perfect job again. They get it done fast yet with precision. Everyone is so friendly there too. Best nail salon I have ever been too. I'm glad I found it. I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out. My first set of acrylics ever... I decided 27 years was a lot enough time to wait, and I'm SO happy with them. I'm not a huge nail person, and was glad to stumble upon this salon. My nail tech was quiet, clean, and very detail-oriented. Very pleased with my experience here and I recommend this place. I called to make an appointment for later today for 3 adults and 2 kids and the man who answered the phone said 'we only have 2 techs today' we can't do that. Poor customer service and I never even went in. Golden Nails has been my nail place for almost a year so it was surprising to see new management. However B did an AMAZING job on my coffin chrome nails and Nancy was extremely helpful figuring out how I wanted my nails done too. Definitely excited to keep coming back! Seriously the best service I have ever gotten at a Tempe nail salon!! I walked in and they helped me right away. Nancy helped me pick the perfect color and was very honest and up front about everything! I wanted something very natural and using the dip method, I love my nails!!","This nail salon is one of the best in the area. The service is excellent.

Everyone is so friendly and kind, I felt so welcomed! B did an amazing job on my nails. He made sure everything was perfect and happily changed something to make me happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants A + work at a totally affordable price. Love it!!:) Amazing service and nails. This is the second time I have been here, they did a perfect job again. They get it done fast yet with precision. Everyone is so friendly there too. Best nail salon I have ever been too. I'm glad I found it. I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out. My first set of acrylics ever... I decided 27 years was a lot enough time to wait, and I'm SO happy with them. I'm not a huge nail person, and was glad to stumble upon this salon. My nail tech was quiet, clean, and very detail-oriented. Very pleased with my experience here and I recommend this place.

Poor customer service and I never even went in. Golden Nails has been my nail place for almost a year so it was surprising to see new management.

I had the garlic stir fry with tofu and brown rice and it was very good. They even got it right when I asked for no mushrooms or water chestnuts. THE BEST Asian Bistro in all of Charlotte!!!! LOVE this place! I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere! As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for. It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks. If you go for lunch and only have an hour, ask for your check as soon as you get your food... might make it out within an hour. BEST SUSHI IN CLT PEOPLE!

They have everything from Pad Thai to Vietnamese, to fresh fish! My favorite is really the sushi, such great food... a must when you are in Charlotte! We went here on a nice night for dinner so we were able to sit outside, which was nice.The food was excellent. We ordered three types of rolls and they were all delicious. They have a good menu of both regular rolls and specialty ones which is nice. They have a good location and I will definitely be back:) I love going to Jade for a evening dinner.

oAq3-dXyDT3k4Mluc1ftTA,"nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation! Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure. One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality.

oDM09XMN-FG0ii_gdVMrTw,"Pretty sure if you've been to one little Caesars pizza you been to them all I have no complaints about this store every time I order I'm in and out quick. They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lol This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8, blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it. Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere... This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.. Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait... Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies. 0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again. I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He / she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape. I have never been there when they have pizza actually ready for customers that are there. They are always behind, and they have very poor customer service skills.","This location is frustrating to deal with and rarely has pizzas hot and read between 4 - 8 pm, as advertised. They have very poor customer service and it's difficult to get through on the phone at times. Sometimes, the pizzas don't taste great, needing more sauce and cheese.

oDM09XMN-FG0ii_gdVMrTw,"Pretty sure if you've been to one little Caesars pizza you been to them all I have no complaints about this store every time I order I'm in and out quick. They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lol This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8, blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it. Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere... This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.. Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait... Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies. 0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again.

Be sure to ask for almond milk if you are vegan:) The barista was so kind to change it out for my friend and I as we forgot to ask about other milk alternatives. Great idea and they use Averys roastery for their coffee! That means the coffee is yummy! The customer service is great! They just need to grow a little! Support them, they deserve it!

I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!! I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry! This store gives me a nice and warm feeling. The feeling that I didn't and won't have with Walmart Market. Trader Joe's has a lot of eye-catching snacks and healthy food. Therefore, I have no idea which items I should buy. If I can, I want to try everything. Absolutely, comeback Checked out this location. Smaller than the Albuquerque NM store that we frequently visit but found the items we were needing but noticed selection was different or maybe I just wasn't finding what I needed. I didn't find the selection of jelly and jams that I wanted but that is okay. Love this store... can't get enough of it. I have been going to Trader Joe's for years. This store always makes me happy. From great recepies idea to great selections of groceries. Staff is really friendly as well. Thumbs up Trader Joe on Camelback Rd! This is a big TJ's. What else is there to say? It's a Trader Joes. Awesome food, great employees. I don't know what I could complain about. Skip Fry's and shop here. The food is healthier and taste better. The parking for this location can be a madhouse because it's located in a very busy strip mall and largely due to the construction surrounding it. But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here. Staff is always awesomely happy and helpful. This is my favorite Joe's. From SF to SD to Scottsdale, the T & C location is the best. Everyone here genuinely knows me and my son. They interact with you like a friend. Products are always great and when they're not they exchange with no hassle. Thanks to the whole staff for always being so welcoming.","This Trader Joe's has a lot of healthy food and snacks.

p3cBYY8Tov5TOaXV2aY-wA,"Very nice staff! It's always packed in here & I'm not surprised! Quality food! Lots of options! I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!! I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry! This store gives me a nice and warm feeling. The feeling that I didn't and won't have with Walmart Market. Trader Joe's has a lot of eye-catching snacks and healthy food. Therefore, I have no idea which items I should buy. If I can, I want to try everything. Absolutely, comeback Checked out this location. Smaller than the Albuquerque NM store that we frequently visit but found the items we were needing but noticed selection was different or maybe I just wasn't finding what I needed. I didn't find the selection of jelly and jams that I wanted but that is okay. Love this store... can't get enough of it. I have been going to Trader Joe's for years. This store always makes me happy. From great recepies idea to great selections of groceries. Staff is really friendly as well. Thumbs up Trader Joe on Camelback Rd! This is a big TJ's. What else is there to say? It's a Trader Joes. Awesome food, great employees. I don't know what I could complain about. Skip Fry's and shop here. The food is healthier and taste better. The parking for this location can be a madhouse because it's located in a very busy strip mall and largely due to the construction surrounding it. But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here. Staff is always awesomely happy and helpful. This is my favorite Joe's. From SF to SD to Scottsdale, the T & C location is the best. Everyone here genuinely knows me and my son. They interact with you like a friend. Products are always great and when they're not they exchange with no hassle. Thanks to the whole staff for always being so welcoming.","The overall feel of the store was very pleasant.

The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes. I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight! Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored. This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well. Very impressed. Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome!!!! Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!! I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment. I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend. The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots. Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well.

qSa3L7cy8Gju4ZLs50ycag,"This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy. Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant! The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back.

qSa3L7cy8Gju4ZLs50ycag,"This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy. Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant! The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back. It's like eating watered down butter with oysters incorporated into it. Highly highly highly recommend CAPTAIN D's;) I am NOT a shellfish fan but the seafood here is really good along w / the hushpuppies! Was recommended by a person I work with and I am glad I went--and have gone several times since then. Just be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line. I don't eat seafood, but they have great chicken and steak for anyone who doesn't like seafood! The place looks very cool on the inside as if you are at the beach. The hush puppies are to die for!! I had the filet of perch and fried oysters and man... They were great! Great portion size for 14 bucks. Even though I got fried it wasn't greasy. I got it to go but the place looked pretty cool to eat at! The fries and hush puppies were good. I will return. It's been awhile since I have been here, but the crab legs were always fantastic. Family friendly restaurant with the best service. The complimentary hushpuppies are delicous and fresh. If you want good home cooking and delish seafood or fish, I will always recommend this place! Awesome fish camp. Portions are very large even with the small ones. The food is amazing! There always super busy so be ready to wait especially on the weekends. We call in a lot to and the staff is always nice and very efficient.","Long wait times to get food. Great restaurant for the family. Portion sizes are big and the food is delicious, if not somewhat fattening and unhealthy. Has a atmospheric inside of the restaurant that feels like being at a beach, though it can get very crowded sometimes.

thYC66m1cYM-uQSkMQePZQ,"Are you kidding me? I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks! Fast and Friendly service! Absolutely delicious!! Seriously finger licking good! The ribs fall right off the bone and they are juicy. I can't wait to go back and try the other items. They also have a daily special every day and it includes sides and a drink. I went in today and everyone was so nice and with a great attitude. Ive been here before and never had any issues, but today it was just great! Makes a difference when you see the workers in a good mood. 3rd Visit within a week. We have been so impressed with the food and staff that we took a friend. We tried something different and once again were very happy that we did. No Question we will be back, and soon if I have anything to do with it. Both times Ive been there, lunch and dinner, they had lines out the door... Free Ice cream, excellent meat, sides, and rolls. Gotta try it to believe it... Dont throw out your yellow cup, refills are only 99 cents on future visits! Not that bad for a chain. I prefer their Texas style brisket and the pulled pork. The Jalapeno beans are pretty good too. I haven't had them yet but the baby back ribs looked amazing. I also really like their spicy BBQ sauce! I have to commend someone from Dickey's BBQ apologizing and asking for my contact information. However, no one ever contacted me and it has been a week. If you're going to follow-up with a customer, do it. I'm so disappointed. Good stuff. It's a national chain, so the menu items, sauces and meats should be consistent from one location to another.That said, what they offer is tasty, authentic bbq. Yum! They even offer big, goofy yellow plastic cups with discounted refills for repeat visits.You can't go wrong with Dickey's BBQ.","Meat, rolls and sides is excellent, ice cream is free.

Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks! Fast and Friendly service! Absolutely delicious!! Seriously finger licking good! The ribs fall right off the bone and they are juicy. I can't wait to go back and try the other items. They also have a daily special every day and it includes sides and a drink. I went in today and everyone was so nice and with a great attitude. Ive been here before and never had any issues, but today it was just great! Makes a difference when you see the workers in a good mood. 3rd Visit within a week. We have been so impressed with the food and staff that we took a friend. We tried something different and once again were very happy that we did. No Question we will be back, and soon if I have anything to do with it. Both times Ive been there, lunch and dinner, they had lines out the door... Free Ice cream, excellent meat, sides, and rolls. Gotta try it to believe it... Dont throw out your yellow cup, refills are only 99 cents on future visits! Not that bad for a chain. I prefer their Texas style brisket and the pulled pork. The Jalapeno beans are pretty good too. I haven't had them yet but the baby back ribs looked amazing. I also really like their spicy BBQ sauce! I have to commend someone from Dickey's BBQ apologizing and asking for my contact information. However, no one ever contacted me and it has been a week. If you're going to follow-up with a customer, do it. I'm so disappointed. Good stuff.

y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"We just had lunch here and it was excellent. Tony is our waiter and he is absolutely amazing! Very helpful, recommended lots of great dishes and extremely attentive. Our food was delicious, dim sum were all very fresh and the wines were great too. Would thoroughly recommend. Dim sum was on point! Service was ridiculously slow. Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for. Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip. We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns! I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent! The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast. We liked it enough to return the next day. It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area. Also, parking is very easy and free. This place is okay for dim sum. It was not too pricey and locals get a discount so make sure to ask for the locals discount. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I'm on the strip and in the mood for dim sum it's worth trying. Overall it was really fine. Awesome selection of dim sum for lunch, service is fast and friendly. Seems like I'm there everyday having lunch. Dinner service is equalling great from authentic Chinese dishes to live seafood you can pick right from the wall of tanks. If you like hot tea don't forget to ask for their wide variety and enjoy!!!","The dim sung was very good.  Food is a little pricey compared to other places, but not too bad.

y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"We just had lunch here and it was excellent. Tony is our waiter and he is absolutely amazing! Very helpful, recommended lots of great dishes and extremely attentive. Our food was delicious, dim sum were all very fresh and the wines were great too. Would thoroughly recommend. Dim sum was on point! Service was ridiculously slow. Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for. Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip. We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns! I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent! The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast. We liked it enough to return the next day. It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area. Also, parking is very easy and free. This place is okay for dim sum. It was not too pricey and locals get a discount so make sure to ask for the locals discount. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I'm on the strip and in the mood for dim sum it's worth trying. Overall it was really fine. Awesome selection of dim sum for lunch, service is fast and friendly. Seems like I'm there everyday having lunch. Dinner service is equalling great from authentic Chinese dishes to live seafood you can pick right from the wall of tanks. If you like hot tea don't forget to ask for their wide variety and enjoy!!!","Good place for a dim sum with prices ranging from average to above average (locals get a discount).

ypSAad4wGe3Uh0N6dgVxaw,"Mgr Dave and salesman Kevin Campbell made the deal very easy for me.!!! My family really loves the car... First Porsche e hybrid I have had .Great car...... modern car tech at its bestGreat experience .I look forward to many more deals with them.Kevin Campbell one of the best salespeople I have experienced in 40 years of buying cars .Bravo Kevin!! Family has purchased a total of 3 purchases within the last 10 years here and the service has been more than excellent. We had an issue with one of the cars, and they fixed it and allowed us to drive a newer model while ours was in repair. This was my first experience at Porsche North Scottsdale and couldn't have been better. Kevin was clear in his explanations and communicated as he said he would. I am very happy with the Macan I bought even having had one service experience to install window tinting. Got taken with efficiency, no waiting, car ready on time. Great customer service all around. Excellent dealership that Prides itself on service and attentiveness. No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman. The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better. I have come to expect more from a Penske company. Just bought a Porsche Panamera s and absolutely love the car! I wish I would have bought one sooner. Owned high end Lexus, Audi, BMW and Mercedes and I like this car best.Got a fair deal and the sale consultant Mark Siffert made it easy and painless. Overall an excellent experience! The best customer service ever! My son wanted the experience of riding in a 911 Turbo. We had the nicest salesman, named Nick, took us for a one of a kind test drive and made my son's day!

zHAR8MmCbjrkNnLGm1ozEQ,"The food is good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. I became an instant Rivas fan after trying what I think is the best chicken burrito in town. Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well. Goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. Three stars because the food was edible. Ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. The three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. It's okay, but not great. This place is very delicious. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the California burrito and they were all very delicious. The horchata and jaimaca are also very good! I definitely recommend this place, don't ever go back to Roberto's! Food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans. Friendly service, Tv was so loud it was uncomfortable, staff didn't seem to mindAs I'm eating a overwhelming smell of pinesol cleaner overtook the taste of my food. Between loud TV and cleaner, I won't be back The wife and I moved to area from San Diego. Heard good about this place. The food looked great. We got our order and it was cold. Such a big disappointment. I will continue to look for a 'good spot' Came here for the steak fries after reading the reviews. Food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good and seemed fresh. The portion size was crazy--way too much to eat. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items. Ordered through Uber eats. Got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. The enchiladas and fries were good. But the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and 'plain nachos' is just chips. I figured nachos would at least come with cheese. Rivas mexican grill sin duda alguna lo recomiendo variedad de comida mexicana. Es una delicia. No hay algo q este en el menú que no me guste. Por la atención calidad de personal. El restaurant super limpio un ambiente agradable.","A clean restaurant with prices a bit above average.

zJzkL4VHHksVVGepR1IAGw,"I do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary. I wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food. What does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini. Food here is really good however I will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them. Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing. My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit. Halifax donair all the way. Back room for a reso is a must. Great space for a 8 - 12 person party. Didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. Same goes for the scallops. The Notorious PIG was a hit with our group. Went to have brunch for Mother's Day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! Had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! The toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy! I'm excited to go back for dinner! Sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious hopgoods foodliner delivers exactly what I'm after: flavour! And lots of it. Service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's liking.Sweetbreads, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and Donairs are what we tried. 4.5 stars! The food was delicious!

I would recommend highly! I have eaten at Fresco three times. The first two times I didn't have any complaints about the food. The tacos are really good. The last time I ordered take out, the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry. The prices are a little high, but the service is fast. I would eat here again. I asked the girl at the counter what was best. She recommended the pork tacos and I was very happy with them. The salsa bar is a cute gimmick, but I'd rather have one really good salsa than ten mediocre ones.",The quality of the food is almost always great. The frozen margaritas and sangria are delicious.

zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,"This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. The ribs are meaty, tender and juicy.A plus is that around 7pm there's live music. We are looking forward to our next meal. Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!! OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket. Could hardly pick it up with a fork. Owner and crew very nice. We'll definitely be back.:) This barbecue joint certainly has a lot to offer it definitely can compete with any barbecue in town or out of town. IMHO, their brisket is top-shelf and you're not like all you can eat catfish. My personal favorite is white beans I like them just like they make-im. Shane was our server the certainly prettiest helpful I highly recommend the joint Food was terrific and the Spicy barbecue sauce was super yummy. Service was not so great. Took a long time for the waitress to take our order. Luckily we were not in a hurry. Food took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not that busy - only about 8 tables. The best BBQ I have had in a long time! Since living in the South!!!! They know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus... vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb! Glad you are in Chandler! Sadly, was not impressed. Sunday brunch, Ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. Meat was VERY burnt and DRY. I was really wanting to like this place. Potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. Hubby said Brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that.","The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender.
