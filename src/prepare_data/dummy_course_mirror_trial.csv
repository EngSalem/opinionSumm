Can other strategies be taken for that problem, such as using the definition of a conditional statement to say true implies false is the only way it can overall be false? And then using that to disprove that it can ever be false? I suppose my confusion was whether that was the only way to formally solve the problem.
Why is the P not upside down like the others? Did they just decide that on a whim or is there a deeper meaning?
Why we use implication for universal is still confusing to me

I had watched it and experimented with it a little bit in the pre-class videos, but it was better in class. For example, I liked expanding the Delta V formula into almost 100 cells in assignment 3. The question using the equation to find delta v was pretty interesting and it gave me a short look at a part of what engineering students do in AAE. I found that changing the number to text format was interesting because the format impacts the graphs and such as well. The use of Excel was not something I was anticipating would be a major part of my engineering education, but makes sense when I put some thought into it. It is like a skeleton I can build off of and put ideas into.","['excel', 'Delta V', 'graphs', 'pre-class videos', 'delta v', 'Excel', 'rocket equation']"

Emma,ENGR131_S014,7,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"I think that the class today was executed well and I’m starting to understand the class in a greater depth.
More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today’s class. Information was given really well.
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar.
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today’s class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn’t see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear.
I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.
The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet
Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.
In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.
I did not find anything confusing today.
Lots of different due dates
The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well
I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
Everything was understandable.
How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing
The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
I found nothing confusing.
Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
Nothing was very confusing.
Nothing was very confusing in today’s class. As we’ve now reached the fourth week of class, I’ve adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments
The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don’t think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn’t find anything that describes these models.
It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
the new project
The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment.
There wasn’t anything too confusing in today’s class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","In today's lecture, most students understood the content. However, many students had questions about aqssignment 10 -- when is it due and how to complete it. A few students were confused about proper citations, and some were confused about what was required for the peer assessments. Students also wanted more details about how reservoirs work. Finally, some students expressed confusion about the new project.",The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it. I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited. How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??

Emma,ENGR131_S014,7,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed looking at the statistics and working with my group in class 4a.
Researching about the reservoir was interesting.
I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project.
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
The reservoir
I liked working with my group today
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles.
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today.
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have.
How hydropower generators worked
I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of.
I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power.
I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened.
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results.
I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing.
The dam
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.
the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so
This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more.
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it.
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators. I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion.
I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting.
The new project about the dam.
How to properly cite your sources.
The introduction to the new assignment
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
Working on real projects that are also interesting
The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
the hydro powered generators
I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting","In this lecture, students overwhelmingly enjoyed learning about how hydroelectric dams and reservoirs work and how hydroelectric power is important. Similarly, many students expressed excitement about the new project, which seems to involve investigating how dams work as well. Students were interested in learning how to find good sources of information (e.g., on Google Scholar and Purdue Library), and students were also interested in how to properly cite those sources.

Emma,ENGR131_S014,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
Excel is still confusing to use.
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered.
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear!
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense!
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins.
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one.
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended?
Nothing really was confusing to me today.
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart.
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me!
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph.
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
Balancing number of bins and bin width
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity.
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
nothing
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel.
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes.
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.
Nothing
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
I felt comfortable today.
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it.
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over.
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at.
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins.
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","In this lecture, students had trouble calculating, editing, and using bins for histograms in Excel. Additionally, students did not understand how to find or when to use overflow and underflow bins. Students were also unsure about which graph is best for a certain situation, and some expressed difficulty creating and understanding histograms in particular.

I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion.
I enjoyed learning excel. It’s a great tool and has a high learning curve which I’m excited to get better at it.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for.
Learning how to work better with histograms
It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender)
Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I’m falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me.
When to use the different types of graphs
i liked working with my group
I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.
The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone’s different graph types.
The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that.
I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn’t know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting
What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset.
I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot.
I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph.
I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
Creating the histograms
I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables
I think using excel is interesting.
I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.
it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting.
histograms
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics.
The break out rooms were interesting.
I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
When the quiz will be.
The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments.
I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting
I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information
I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
Ways to use histograms to show data.
I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting because you can use multiple graph types for data.
I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us
It was interesting to learn about histograms.
What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes, because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
I may say the quiz and how to take it.","In this lecture, students were interested in histograms; specifically, they enjoyed learning how to create, edit, and manipulate histograms, as well as the purpose of histograms and when/how they should be used.

Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.
Calculating z values
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments
I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.

I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting.
I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring.
I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart.
I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
Skittles are weird
The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics.
Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand.
The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
using Z score chart was the most interesting
I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used.
I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
Histogram uses in excel
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning.
Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together.
The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
Remembering how to do Z-scores
Everything else was Interesting
One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability.
The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table.

The function of the z-score
I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","In this lecture, students were most interested in learning about z-scores, especially the z-score chart. Students were also interested in how to find probabilities using z-scores, histograms, or from real data.

Emma,ENGR131_S015,6,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained
How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
Nothing was confusing today during class
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I wasn’t really confused today
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
Nothing, class was great as usual
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I am not sure about exactly what z value does
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
Nothing really
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail.
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate.
Nothing was confusing for me
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I’m still not sure what it determines.
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
nothing, everything was clear today
Data types
One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing.
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
What we had to do in class
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","In this lecture, students were confused about the instructions for Assignment 8, especially how to address the missing data. Some students also struggled with Assignment 5. Furthermore, students expressed confusion about how to find and use z-scores and what they meant. Students also think they would benefit from more practice with probability. Finally, students were confused about the directions for the in class work and how to complete and submit the Skittles assignment.","Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel. Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better. I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.

Emma,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today’s class?,"A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture.
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content.
during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing.
One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout?
I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms are found to be somewhat confusing.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help.
I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it.
Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users.
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
Nothing was really confusing about today’s class.
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups.
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples.
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.
Test
Everything made sense.
nothing was really confusing in today’s class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms.
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
Under flow and over flow
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them.
Some of the histogram stuff was fast
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources.
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments.
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
Details about which graphs to use when.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well.
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.","In this lecture, many students were confused about the difference between data types like categorical and numerical, ordinal and nominal, and discrete and continuous. Many students also expressed confusion about how to format histogram bins properly. Additionally, some students were confused about how to make a histogram in general; students particularly noted that they’d like more instruction on how to construct histograms in Excel on Mac. A few students wanted more clarification on what graph to use to represent certain data types. Some also expressed that they didn’t have enough time to fully understand the material.","Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me.

Emma,ENGR131_S015,7,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn’t much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.
Everything explained was clear.
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
N/A
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
Nothing
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
I am confused how the laminar approach works.
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this.
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources.
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
How to search for data quickly.
The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained.
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful.
I didn't find anything confusing today.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
I was confused on parts of assignment A10
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
nothing
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific.
how to use the outside resources information in the research
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","In this lecture, students were confused about how to complete assignment A10. Additionally and more specifically, students were confused by how to use the Laminar approach and how to employ mathematical models in this assignment. Similarly, students were confused about how to complete the in-class activity and what was being asked; some needed more time.

Emma,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done.
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself.
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
The histogram plotting and the activity A07
I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
Test
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.
I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting.
I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
Learning more about my breakout group
The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram.
The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.
I found it interesting how to use a histogram
I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
The in class activity
I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","In today's lecture, students were most interested in histograms, including how to make and utilize them and some of their general properties. Students also enjoyed learning about what charts to use to represent different variables and data types the best.

I thought your explanation of ammeters and voltmeters was very well done. This topic that was previously confusing to me in high school is now much clearer. I thought it was interesting thinking about how current runs through a wire and why each of these have to have very different resistances.
I’ve used multimeters before. But never considered that just measuring would impact the circuit itself so your reading will never be 100% true. Was just a little interesting and never thought about it before. since the meter will just extend the circuit and draw some energy. neat.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific
In today’s class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today’s class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could’ve been more in-depth.
I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense.
I really didn’t understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it’s q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn’t know where to go from there to solve for F’ or F because I didn’t know what it defined as F’ and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.
I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
i enjoyed today’s class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn’t understand this because i couldn’t seem to figure out why that one force just became 0.
I think today’s class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture.
I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today’s class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I’m having trouble understanding the difference between the two.
I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn’t watch the prerecorded lectures before hand.

I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don’t drink coffee, so I didn’t really have much perspective for the problem.

How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
I wasn’t confused on any concept from today’s class.
We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping.
There wasn’t much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17
The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.

I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn’t have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would’ve been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information.

One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn’t see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don’t understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis.
Nothing confusing for today
it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
There wasn’t really anything in today’s lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints
I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.
The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation’s other than to try to trip us up.
I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.
How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
Nothing in today’s class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
I think what was explained in class made sense. I’m glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from.

One thing that was confusing about today’s class was do you account for criteria that isn’t stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
Something that could have used more details in today’s class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn’t really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we’re supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information
Nothing
I was confused on the metrics section.
The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn’t seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
Not much was confusing in today’s class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
I didn’t think much was confusing in today’s class, as I felt I understood the material very well.
More details about what is due for the first milestone
I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bit confusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
Nothing really
In the beginning, we weren’t sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
nothing was confusing
How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren’t on campus and also when we don’t know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
Nothing
I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project.
I didn’t find anything too confusing in today’s class.
I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn’t really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
In this class there wasn’t much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming
It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue","Many students today seemed to be confused by their assignment 16 and its requirements, while other students were confused about the project that they had to complete. Some complained about the workload of the project. There were other students that were confused by certain concepts, such as stakeholders, criteria and constraints, and scoping. Some students also wanted more guidance on in class quizzes.","I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve.

Baxi,ENGR131_S015,20,,"Today’s class was little confusing and I didn’t need any extra details.
Prototyping
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes.
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally.
Nothing was confusing in today’s class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
Something that could use more details in today’s class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn’t catch all the dates.
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes.
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
Everything made sense into today’s class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don’t have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren’t easily accessible.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making.
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test.
How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.
I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process.
I wasn’t confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
I would’ve appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes.
Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don’t always have the resources
What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do.
How in depth the experiments should be
I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype.
Nothing today
nothing was confusing
The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn’t understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room
Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
Everything was clear and easy to understand
How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
Nothing
the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear
I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details","A majority of the students today were confused about prototyping and testing through their modeling softwares.

Baxi,ENGR131_S015,17,,"starting our own design project
I found the client stakeholder relations to be very interesting as well as the differences between a anovice and professional engineer.
Differences between client and end user
I liked working on problem scoping and developing ways to measure constraints and criteria
The project that was assigned to us for the final design was very interesting especially when we went into breakout rooms and discussed it
The issue of improving campus safety sounds interesting.
Learning about problem scoping and the upcoming design project
That we are creating our own ideas to a problem we are given.
I found working on the in class assignment to be most interesting.
The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project to work on with my team
The most interesting part of today’s class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project.
I did not realize that we had been slowly incorporating different aspects of design into our assignments
Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project
starting a new project was the most interesting today
It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem.
Before today’s class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today’s class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I’d been confused on it for so long.
I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you’re doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers.
Design issues as a whole
I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.
Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting
I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one.
It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
Something interesting in today’s class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it.
The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
The design problem was quite interesting.
Explanation for the campus mobility project
Leaning about problem scoping and the extent to which prior research is required before starting any sort of ideas
The beginning of the project, everything seems fun
I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers. Particularly asking questions and research.
I found the designing interesting of this project interesting. I'm very excited to do this project.
Not much was interesting in this class, we were confused by stuff most of the time.
The whole project I thought was interesting.
The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we’re excited for the upcoming project.
Writing and combining 3 problem statements
writing the problem statement
It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don’t repeat them.
I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.
Trade off
I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting
I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer
There wasn’t anything very interesting today, maybe a different approach to the project explanation could help engage students.

Baxi,ENGR131_S015,15,,"Learning the co2 emissions of our vehicles.
That the corolla produced 260 grams of CO2 per mile, that is actually quite bit.
I found the discussion on design trade offs very interesting
I found the way to find my car’s carbon emission very interesting.
I found the entire lecture on the environment and our carbon footprint interesting.
What I found most interesting in class was the amount of everyday life that contributes to your personal carbon footprint. I took the survey from the link shown in class to determine my own.
The group time was very helpful and the carbon emissions talk was very interesting to learn about my personal effect
What I found most interesting about today’s class was how engineers have to take into account everything that is going on into the world around them and apply that to the job they are doing.
I found the website to calculate your personal carbon footprint interesting.
It was interesting discussing how we, as engineers, are responsible for the climate because it effects human safety.
The in class activity was an interesting way to practice unit conversions
I liked the theory at the beginning of the class when we talked about trade offs
Something I found most interesting in today’s class was the inclusion of carbon emissions and their importance to our project and their impact on the world we live in. Connecting it to engineering as a whole helped stress the importance of being aware of how your projects may impact the world and others.
Something interesting in today’s class was the carbon footprint website, because it was cool to see the impact I have on the world.
I found it interesting how you can estimate your own carbon footprint.
Project 3 is really interesting and is reminding me how much I enjoy industrial engineering and mathematical calculations and analyses.
The criteria and constraints were very useful to think about what my group needs to consider still.
I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
What I found most interesting was the carbon footprint. I knew about calculating my own carbon footprint but it never occurred to me to calculate something like my cars carbon footprint.
global warming website to show the changes over time
It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
The interaction was interesting
I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts
Learning about trade offs was pretty interesting in today’s lecture. I also like that we are focusing on carbon footprints. Anytime we learn about the environment in any way, I am happy with that respective session
The most interesting part about today’s class was to do the in class activity with the car CO2 emited, is interesting to learn more about our impact to the environment
I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
CO2 footprint

Dipoles
I like answering some of the more basic questions about dipoles in the electric field because it solidifies the topics and gives you a basis to answer more challenging problems.
It was interesting to see what dipoles are and how it effects in real life especially with the cool video it was easier to understand the real life example
video demonstration
I thought it was cool that the charged metal bar was able to attract the polar water. Even when the charge was changed it still attracted the water which was cool.
I found the demonstration with electric fields and flowing water most interesting because it proves that dipoles will always attract to the strongest charge, regardless of it being positive or negative.
I found the demonstration of how the dipole would rearrange itself in the electric field to be interesting.
the final problem about dipoles was most interesting as total mechanical energy has to be solved.
The video demonstrations
How dipoles in a uniform electric field do not experience a net force, only torque.
The video with the water bending
I thought it was really interesting that opposite charges placed further apart have a greater electric field, because it is the opposite of what you would assume.
I thought that the video showing that water molecules were attracted to the charred rod was pretty interesting. The video confused me a little though.
I found the explanation to the open ended tophat the most interesting because so many people got the same wrong answer as me.
I liked the geogebra graphs because they helped me visualize how torque and potential energy change with respect to the angle.
The fact that water will be attracted to a charge regardless if it is positive or negative
I found the electric dipoles and how they line up with the electric field interesting.

You can solve calc 3 integrals without having to integrate
How the flux can change based on the side.
I really enjoyed solving the first integration problem. I was confused about it first but that problem clarified my confusion.
the flux equation
I found that only needing to consider the electric field component that is perpendicular to dA the most interesting. It's like how you feel more resistance in a water current if you're holding a flat piece of metal with the surface facing the current rather than perpendicular to it.
I found it interesting to do another integral problem because it shows how the integration formula is used in many different scenarios and helps me to visualize how the components cancel on different shapes.
The concept of flux
I found it interesting that the y component canceled out when doing the example with the charge on a semi-circle. This makes these types of questions much easier to compute.
I felt like todays class helped me understand some of the concepts I have been struggling with. I really liked how we did more examples that were walked through than clicker questions.
I liked solving for the flux on the cube and comparing the sides. It helped me understand the concept better.

Negative flux means the electric field lines are going into the enclosed object
The problem we worked on together as a class

The first top hat question
Calculating electric field vs. Electric force was the only confusing part of the lecture
The components of the electric field were confusing
I was confused as to how there being more field lines meant that the magnitude of the electric field was higher. Is the strength of a field at a point determined by how close the field lines are together or by how close the point is to the charge?
I was a bit confused by the question with the charges diagonal from each other
Are electric field lines the path that a test charge follows if it is placed near a charge particle or is it just a way to visualize forces?

Concise and easy to follow, helpful by using examples and posing tophat questions so that students could bounce off ideas.
I believe the stocks, flows, and feedback loop can use more details. The professor went through these very quickly. It would be better if the professor can talk a bit more slowly while adding more details to each topic.
This lecture was kind of boring to go through. It felt like the lecture was dragging on.
The most confusing thing for me today was the reasoning of stock, flows, and feedback loops. I think I somewhat understand what each means, but that too is a little confusing. I did not understand why we label different systems with these names. What does it mean for each system?

Hailey,CMPINF 0010,19,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"I found how he explained the different aspects of SCI was great. It would have been a great talk to have as a freshman when deciding what to think about moving forward as a SCI student. Also, the integration of many different fields into computing and information was delightfully surprising.
The variety of different research opportunities at Pitt. They cover a broad range of computer science applications.
We learned about him attending Caltech University, as well as how long he has worked at Pitt and how he initially received the position.
As I had said before, I found that the Research Teams and projects discussed were very intriguing and made me want to learn more about them and get involved with these groups.
I enjoyed how he went into different majors and course requirements which was helpful.
I enjoyed learning about the different areas of computer science that are a part of the school of computing and information.
I enjoyed the little QnA at the end, and hearing about different application of CS research within my own community was interesting.
The research projects. I liked how they many different options and paths were available.
I found the explanations of all the majors very useful , interesting, and digestible. Also while confusing, the research portion was quite interesting and I do wish to take part in research.
The different research studies that you could get involved in.
I found the sharing of the research at SCI the most interesting.
The research opportunities!
Many research opportunities
The projects discussed
Learning about our professor!
I liked the research that was presented that was going on in SCI
I found the research opportunities most interesting in this lecture. I enjoyed that there were a variety of opportunities available to undergraduates in varying topics. I found the Smart City project most compelling overall and would be interested to know more about it.
I found the emphasis on the social and interpersonal aspects of Computing and Information to be interesting.This seems like a very well-rounded curriculum.
I found information sciences and the psychology aspect of Computing and Information to be the most interesting. I did not realize that Computing and Information can have such a broad spectrum beforehand.
The research projects available.
Learning about all the volunteering opportunities was valuable
I found it pretty interesting to learn what this class would actually be focused on. I also think it added some distinction to my future studies. By that I mean it pointed out classes necessary for some majors in computer science such as video game design, which is a field so am personally interested in studying.
I liked learning about the Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major because I am now interested in pursuing that degree.
I enjoyed learning about the overall course
I enjoyed learning about the overall course
I got to learn more about what different research opportunities are which was nice. I knew I wanted to do undergraduate research but I did not realize how many different fields there are for research or how to reach out to professors.
The tophat is a pretty interesting app that we all can see the stats of response. This app helps us get more involved in the class.
What I found most interesting was just getting to learn about the topics that we would cover in the semester, and the research topics that some of the faculty are covering. I found it interesting because it gave me ideas of what I could possibly do for research in the future while in SCI and it was fascinating seeing just how much was being done in such a new school. I also enjoyed getting to learn about the professor, I found that to be interesting as we got to know him a little more personally.

Today's class was much easier to understand than the others
nothing was confusing
Why emojis appear different of different phones with different OS.
I found the bitmaps/raster images part of the lecture to be confusing because I do not understand how bits can be translated to colors.
I thought that everything was explained well and there wasn't much that was confusing for me. All of the topics covered were thoroughly reviewed.
I think spending a bit more time on how audio is abstracted exactly. How do we manage not to lose all that info?
I thought the relation of the Funes reading to abstraction could be clarified further. I also thought that encoding audio could be explained further as well.
I found code space and the explanation of UTF-8 to be the most confusing parts. How does UTF relate to programming languages? Is there a certain point where more code space has decreasing utility?
I felt like how sounds and photos/ videos are processed by a computer was still a little confusing
What I found confusing in todays lecture was the quick changing of decimal numbers to binary and back.
The only confusing thing was how a computer knows how to interpret a set of bytes
The connection of the story of the assignment to how it relates to class and abstraction
Converting ASCII to binary was slightly confusing at first, but I eventually got it.
Nothing in particular really confused me this class, I think abstraction makes sense to me now after spending a whole class on it.
I was a little confused on how to convert letters to 1s and 0s
Introducing the concept of binary to the class
Nothing was confusing for me. It was clear and understandable personally
I was still confused on abstraction as it's application in a real world scenario. I know it allows for an easier understanding of something, so what's another simple example to show that?","In this lecture, the most confusing part of the lecture for most students was binar conversions and how binary is processes by a computer.

nothing was confusing
I found industrial capitalism to be most confusing because I do not understand how it relates to computing and information.
The ideas about Surveillance capitalism were a bit difficult to grasp. Not everything clicked with me and made sense.
What does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque versus transparent?
I felt that filter bubbles were slightly confusing. There could have been more of an explanation into how intellectual isolation can impact our society.
How surveillance relates to other areas of computing and such. It was confusing since we only looked at the video
The most confusing thing from todays class was the opaque and other categories that there are when it comes to data collection.
what exactly exho chambers have to do with computers and how they work with info.
What specifically a Weapon of Math Destruction can extend to, if it covers specific things or general ideas
There was nothing in particular confusing about todays lecture. Arjun explained everything very clearly and I had no issues understanding.

Hailey,CMPINF 0010,20,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I didnt find anything confusing today in class; the information was well explained and clear.
I thought it was pretty good. I think that having some examples of how things like abstraction and decomposition can work together to solve certain problems
Nothing. It was very clear today
I didnt find anything confusing today in class; the information was well explained and clear.
Why computers are not needed in computing. This was not touched on using abstraction which made it confusing for me
I was a little confused on the concept of Abstraction. I'm not sure what the benefits of more abstraction versus less abstraction is.
I didn't find anything confusing.
I need more details of abstraction in computing world. But the real won't example is easy to understand
I thought that everything in today's class was thought out and well explained. There wasn't that much that I thought was confusing. But if I had to pick, I'd probably say the index and concordance.
Very clear in speech and used many examples to help explain concepts. However, there was some confusing regarding the distinction between algorithms and abstraction.
Some of abstraction was not super clear. Some parts were, like the detailed face to the cartoon face, but the pasta one confused me a little bit
Abstraction was probably the most confusing part of the lecture and maybe even more examples would better solidify my understanding of it
It all made sense to me, and it was easier to hear your lecture today from the back.
Time could have been managed better, felt like we were rushing towards the end. Fathers Busa Algorithm--the how was difficult to understand
Most if not everything was covered thoroughly and clearly. I don't believe I have any confusing or pressing questions.
I felt that abstraction was slightly confusing. I understand that it is reducing complexity but I am having trouble coming up with examples or visualizing how it applies to programming. I felt that there was also confusion on the article assignments for that class.
I would have maybe liked to hear more ways that the concepts (abstraction, pattern recognition, etc.) are applied within programming/CS on a regular basis instead of so many figurative examples
The ending was a bit confusing about all of the different categories. Also went abit fast at the end.
Nothing was confusing
I would have liked a little more information on the distinction between algorithms, decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition. I understand that they will have overlap and often multiple ideas will apply to one process, but- for example- when is between breaking something down step by step decomposition versus when is that making an algorithm? Does it depends on the context that it occurs in, or are there some defining factors that would help determine which idea it would apply to?
Today, I was a little confused on the details of abstraction. I think out of the four we learned it was the most confusing for me. I think the part that threw me off the most was the examples we used. To elaborate, the example in class seemed straight forward, but class examples were different that caused confusion for myself. In class, I understood the stick people analogy, and think I needed just a few more to really grasp the concept.
A think a bit more information on each of the different types, why are each so important
I was sort of iffy on what qualifies as pattern recognition
Personally, I thought that everything in the lecture was pretty straightforward. However, I do think it would be beneficial to include more examples, specifically computing examples, of decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition.","In this lecture, the differences between algorithms, decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition were confusing for students, and many said more examples would be helpful--especially for abstraction.

Hailey,CMPINF 0010,19,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I thought the class was well worked through today. Most of the topics were covered in great detail and the allowance of questions at the end was a fun way to wrap things up.
The specifics of upcoming assignments. Little information was given on assignments due soon.
Today was our first lecture, and it served as more of an introductory lecture. The class had a welcoming vibe, and the professor seemed nice. He spoke in a very clear manner and was audible throughout the lecture. He frequently asked the class for questions and made sure to answer the questions effectively and thoroughly. He constantly monitored the zoom meeting while attending to the students in the classroom. Overall, great lecture.
I thought that today's class was very informative and wasn't really too confusing at all. The Research projects and teams were explained well and very interesting to learn about.
Today I really had a tough time hearing. I wish the professor would have projected his voice louder. I was sitting in the back but was too shy to mention my issue. Also, I wish when my classmates asked a question, the question was repeated back by the professor so all of the students could hear what was being asked.
I would like to hear more about CS research opportunities around Pittsburgh and at Pitt. I was always unsure of what exactly CS research covered, although I am very interested in getting involved with it.
what is involved in a research project. I don't know what is involved in a research project.
I thought a lot of confusing terminology was used when explaining unfamiliar topics, so I was further confused. Especially during the research portion of the class I was confused since research is already a confusing idea, so the brief explanation was not very understandable for a completely new student to the topic.
The only thing that i thought needed more detail is how exactly the skills labs and the lectures and different in content. I would like to know what exactly is in each section.
I think that the research explanations were biased on the biology connected ones, so it would have been nice to see a lengthy explanation for the other research projects at SCI too.
Do we have to know how to code in python already or do we learn that in the skills lab?
Nothing!
Voice was sometimes hard to hear in the back of the room.
Nothing
Nothing really, the introduction was good, and it was interesting to learn about research
Nothing was too confusing, since it was just introductions. The only suggestion would maybe be to speak a little louder
Nothing in class needed further elaboration as it was only the first day and topics are more likely to be elaborated later on in the course.
I thought that most of the topics explained were explained thoroughly and to the fullest extent possible. All of the research opportunities had in depth explanations into the topics being researched and the methods used to explore these topics. I felt that I have an in depth understanding of what this class will require and the types of activities that will be completed during both lectures and labs. We specifically talked about grading systems of 110% top scores to provide for additional opportunities to receive high scores as well as the policies and procedures the teacher has in place for the class. The only thing that could have used further clarification was the involvement of Python in the course and how often prior experience is required for the course.
When the professor explained the research possibilities available to first year students, their meanings were confusing. it would have been nice to have explanations of the terminology used.
I was confused when the professor went over the different research projects because I did not understand how it correlated to Computing and Information. I think it would have helped if he went into further detail about each research projects.
Nothing was too confusing. Nice introduction to the class. Could possibly use some specific example of what we will learn.
Nothing was confusing, it was the first day of class so it was fun
This class was mostly just introduction stuff so nothing was really complicated. I expect more to come in the future, but this was a good start to the class and to the instructor. Looking forward to the next classes
This was an introductory lecture. I learned about the different opportunities available to me in SCI, the School of Computing and Information. I liked hearing about the different degree programs available and I was very interested in digital narrative and interactive design because it could combine the create parts of my personality with my computer knowledge.
Everything made sense
I want to know more specific details about the class. Like what kind of the ""big ideas"" we are talking about. Also how does the big ideas relates and effect our real world of daily life.
I did not find anything in particular very confusing. He did a very good job of explaining the content that we would need. We went over all of the content in pretty good detail which I found to be very helpful so I do not think there is anything else that he could have done instead.
The explainations could be simpler. When presenting the majors other than CompSci avaliable I felt they didn't get as much spotlight.","In this lecture, most students found nothing confusing.

How binary works is very interesting since its very fundamental to computers
learning to count in binary
How images, sounds, and characters are represented by numbers.
The most interesting thing I found in class today was that we can convert letters and numbers to binary.
I thought that the ways that computers read and transcribe audio and video was really interesting.
Binary code translation into numbers and letters
The most interesting part was the application of emojis stored in unicode as well as audio encodings in relation to MP3 players.
I really liked the MP3 explanation and hearing the ghost in the MP3, it was cool to see a concrete example of what an abstraction process does.
I found it interesting learning how to read binary code
What I found interesting in todays class was how audio files are compressed
The activity where we had to calculate the asciii for our favorite move
Learning how to read binary numbers was probably the most interesting part of todays lecture.
The Nintendo example, it's easy to understand because the graphics of different consoles are so different
I thought that the concept of initializing emojis/photos was very interesting
Learning about how numbers and emojis came to be
I found the binary conversions interesting. Furthermore I found the ASCII tables more interesting.

I thought that the write up on pigeons and their data sending capabilities was a really cool topic to read up on.
The guest speaker
the examples that were given
What I found interesting in todays class was how birds could transmit data faster than some methods we have nowadays because of the amount of storage that can fit in such a small space
I really enjoyed discussing the IAPoC system. I love pigeons. It was also interesting discussing the different types of data transfer in both a digital and biological sense.
I thought that sharing the medium was interesting.
All of the different ways different animals communicate with one another.
Comparisons
I found the different examples using Alice pretty interesting.
The ways that the ants communicated
I found the multiplexing interesting because I've dabbled in networks before and learning about the origins was interesting.
I liked discussing the real world examples involving computational communication like with Amazon
I found the part with communications for humans to be most interesting. It allowed me to further understand the lesson by relating to something we all do.
Wasnt super interesting to be honest
NA
The common themes among all communication processes.
The Shannon connection
learning about how these methods of communication related to biology
I found learning about IPOAC was pretty interesting. I liked how that example tied in with the various subtopics like multiplexing and latency.
I liked learning about the bees and the communication between them and how the ants communicated too
It was interesting to learn about some of the key ideas of communication through an example of the postal system. The terms that related to communication was more understandable because the examples were from the mailing system.
Pigeons being able to carry terabytes of data is incredible and was shocked when I found out that it's faster in raw bandwidth than human engineered devices
The pigeons
Talking about how computer science used ants for research on how stuff should work
Probably the way multiplexing works and what a browser does to load a page.
The use of pigeons
Diving deeper into how the communication process works along with the receiving end. It was also cool to learn about the pigeons
I liked learning about how animals (mostly the ants) communicate with each other, and leave signals and chemical signs
What I found most interesting was the amount of information we could pass if we were to still use messenger pigeons. Sometimes old methods work as well as others.
Those real world examples, like send greeting cards
I found the idea of thinking of machine communication alongside humans communicating and animals communicating very interesting.
how to optimize information and data being sent
Pigeons having more latency","In this lecture, students enjoyed the discussion of different animal computing examples (expecially carrier pigeons) in comparison to machine computing processes. Students additionally found other real-life examples provided interesting, such as that of the postal service.

Hailey,CMPINF 0010,20,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"I found the idea of abstractions very interesting
I liked how you described the 4 big parts of computing and how they can help you when coding
The top hat exercises were quite interesting
Computational Thinking was decently interesting
I found the idea of abstractions very interesting
The breakdown on computing and explanation of algorithms.
I really enjoyed the examples you gave at the end of class. seeing some real world applications of computing even before computers was useful and interesting.
what computational thinking is and the purpose of it
The paper airplane example really helps me to understand the idea of algorithm
Ability to ask random questions
It was interesting how varied the amount of steps were for making a paper airplane. Different levels of specificity were displayed
I though the idea that we don't need computers to compute was cool. The different levels and processes that go into computing were also interesting.
The applications of computational thinking throughout history. It is very cool to see the process applied to real-world changes.
Learning about how everyday tasks are similar to how computers handle tasks given to them and how humans use computing everyday
The algorithms used in real life were fun.
I found it interesting that to think computationally you have to think like a computer and that computers need very precise instructions to do a task
The different sorts of tasks that can be algorithms and abstraction were interesting
mechanical computations
I found going through all 4 areas of computational thinking interesting. The fact that there are different ways to go about solving a problem is interesting.
Hearing the history of German cryptography
The paper airplane algorithm discussion although it was cut short.
The idea of computational thinking in humans
I found the real life examples of computing/ computational thinking very interesting, especially the ones from before we had modern computers.
I found interesting that there are 4 types of computation and that computation is not only computers but about human thinking.
I found the concept of human computations interesting. I also enjoy using Tophat.
Learning about the ways people used computing before computers was most interesting to me because I do not hear about it often. The majority of the people now directly relates computing to computers, even though we have been computing since the beginning. Therefore, I enjoyed learning about the antikythera mechanism and abacus, which dated thousands of years back.
I liked hearing everyones examples of each type of computational thinking.
The discussions of translating human thought processes to one that can be interpreted by a computer
I thought that it was very interesting to talk about real-world examples of the various different topics, such as pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and algorithm. I think it helps to understand the topic more when we are able to relate it to things in our own lives.
I enjoyed discussing the process of how both humans and computers compute, especially how each has their own strengths, such as the emotions and wisdom of humans compared to the mathematical and calculating computers.
The paper plane activity and taking into consideration what you consider steps and what is unnecessary to include in the 5 step process.","In this lecture, the most interesting concepts were those of human computing, as well as explanations of the 4 main concepts in computing.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,9,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I enjoyed the regression practice web game that was demonstrated in class. It helped me practice regression identification.
I found the things about r^2 and correlation to be interesting.
The trendline was the most interesting.
The trendlines were interesting.
How a scatter plot can determine the correlation of data points
Finding the regression line during the in class activity was very interesting
The most interesting part of class was the in class activity because it allowed me to practice with regression on excel.
I liked the demonstration of the game to understand correlation. Using outside sources seems to help very well.
The studio time was very helpful and the TA was able to help answer many questions
I enjoyed the growing time spent in breakout rooms
I found it interesting to learn about editing trendlines especially being able to see how they work on an apple products as they are often excluded from being taught in high school.
i liked working in groups and having more time to work on the project
Grading is based on general criteria of approach and not smaller data bits.
I liked how we got lots of time to work on the project and get our assignments nearly finished in our groups.
I found it interesting how you linked the overall slope of the trend line up with the reservoir and its volumes. This is significantly helpful when approaching the mathematical models my group and I created.
I think making the scatter plots with the regression lines was interesting because after practicing it l was able to quickly construct the charts and A11 became very easy.
I found it interesting how the r shows how strong the correlation of the regression line and the data is, and simply squaring that would tell you the percentage of data that the line accounts for.
Something I found interesting was the “guess the correlation” website. It looks fun and I think it can help understand what r and correlation actually mean about a graph.
In today’s class, I found the information on the r value to be the most interesting. Based on the negative or positive slope of the tread line, one can determine if the value of r is positive or negative.
I really liked the extra time to work on A11. However I was thrown off because my team already submitted A10 because in brightspace it said “Due before class 5A”.
The breakout room sessions this class were pretty interesting due to certain happenings.
We just found out that the entire technical brief is not due until later and we only need to do a little more work.
How simple it was to create a regression model with the r2 value is on excel.
I found the example on linear regression to be interesting, as well as the statistics that go into calculating the SST and SSE.
I absolutely love breakout rooms! My team and I get a lot of work done during that time and it really allows us to revise our project and help one another.
The most interesting part of the class was finding more about the Taum Sauk hydroelectric plant. Also being able to finish my in class activity in class for the first time.
I found it interesting to compare out group’s results with the results shown in class.
The different ways that a trend line could be manipulated to explain the data
I found the website used for guessing the r^2 value to be really interesting! It was really fun to mess around with for a little bit, but I personally find it extremely difficult to guess it exactly correctly. I also didn’t know how to make the linear regression line visual in excel until today, so that’s really good to know.
I found the regression equation function in Excel to be the most interesting part of the class.
What i found most interesting was creating the graph for the in class activity. I watched the module quiz and knew and understood what had to be done but forgot how to so doing that activity helped me remember.
I found the way Excel can calculate the equation of the regression line and r^2 value to be interesting.
The graph at the end of the relation between height and volume
I thout that learning to generate the linear regression with Excel was a useful tool.
Our application of regression lines to the Taum Sauk Reservoir is interesting to learn about. I also liked the practice we got in class.
Regression lines
I found spending time working with my group to be most interesting because we had a great discussion and were able to fully understand parts of assignment 10 that we were confused about.
How the r squared value relates to the independent and dependent variables was interesting and the correlation of the data based on how close this value is to 1 was interesting.
I liked that the slides were available during class. It made the in class activity so much easier. Also, if we were confused on something you went over it was easy for us to go back over it on our own using the slides to understand it.
After hearing you talk about how regression works and how it can be implemented into excel and it made much more sense
I found the simple linear regression to also be most interesting because of it’s applications for analyzing data.
What I found interesting about today’s class was how you can turn any model into an equation that can be used to represent volume at any height.
I really enjoyed learning about how to apply a line of best fit to a data set and hoe to interpret this line and r squred value.
Regression Lines
nothing
I enjoyed guessing the r^2 value for the online game. It was fun to try to determine the correlation of the data.
We got a lot done in the breakout rooms and the discussion on r values was very productive
assignment 11
I found working with best fit lines and creating graphs to display a visual model of tables.
What was most interesting with finding the correlations of data points and the website that shows this
today was mostly a work day so interacting with my team mates were probably the most interesting
I think that the correlation coefficient and the regression lines are interesting because I have a background in statistics and I think that it is cool to learn about.
It was interesting to learn how to do regression lines on excel.
Regression model with detail instruction
I felt that the trendline lesson was important because it’s something that we will continue to use for the rest of our career.
Nothing really it was how to do linear regression
The demonstration for how to create a trend line in excel for mac
Learning about regression and the sum errors and the formulas
The most interesting part of todays class was learning about regressions and the different components of a regression line like the R^2 variable and its purpose.
The trends and how we can relate them to our data
how usefull linear regression could be, it was well explained
This class had a nice setup into A11 which will be cool to see. I can’t wait to get started on it.
the calculation of r-squared values to decide how accurate the data is in relation to the trendline was very interesting.
creating trend line
finding regression lines and a line of best fit
Nothing really shockingly interesting today. Just more of a work day
I found editing the linear regression charts was interesting.
I found it interesting how simple and easy the regression lines were to create in microsoft excel.
How to find and format trend lines in excel
I found it interesting when we were learning how to do the line of best fit in microsoft excel.
getting a mathematical model for our resorvoir radius and volume
I found it interesting to look at statistics on how the Taum Sauk Reservoir works
Everything in today’s class was interesting because it added on to things I learned from high school.

all of the different resources for trustworthy information was interesting. I didnt know there were so many places
Learning about and getting an introduction to hydropower and the impact of turbines. As well as learning about the upcoming assignment about.
the upper taum samk reservoir is a failure.
It was interesting to learn about hydroelectric generators, and also how the taum sauk reservoir was the biggest natural battery that existed and also how it had failed at one point due to poor building and not stopping the pump.
The thing I found most interesting in today’s class was the video on hydroelectric power. The explanation to reinforce what we learned during the in-class activity helped me feel like I understand the groundwork for the topic.","In this lecture, students were interested in the background information about the upcoming project.

The different ways to find helpful research articles and reliable sources The most interesting part of today’s class was working with my teammates and sharing ideas with them.,"['The video we watched about how hydroelectric dams work was interesting', 'how the taum sauk reservoir was the biggest natural battery', 'the most interesting thing I learned during this meeting was that reservoirs can be essentially used as massive batteries', 'learning about the upcoming assignment', 'I found interesting the shape of the reservoir', 'Learning about hydropower was interesting', 'I thought that learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting', 'The different ways to find helpful research articles and reliable sources', 'What I found most interesting in today’s class was how hydroelectric plants work', 'researching how hydropower works', 'I found the complexity of the reservoir very interesting', 'all of the different resources for trustworthy information was interesting', 'enjoyed doing the research on how hydroelectric generators function', 'I found it interesting how we can manipulate our data for the upcoming assignment', 'I found the idea of the assignment interesting', 'It was interesting to see the new project we will work on', 'Researching the Tatum Sauk reservoir', 'What I found most interesting was when reading about what needed to be completed for A10', 'The new team assignment', 'I find hydropower very interesting', 'Learning about and getting an introduction to hydropower and the impact of turbines', 'I enjoy water projects so this is a cool thing to start', 'The mathematical models we have to do in activity 10', 'The work we completed on proper sources', 'Starting a new project is very interesting', ""I'm very interested in formulating the volume calculation for the reservoir"", 'I found the explanation on hydroelectric power interesting', 'I really loved talking with my team', 'I found it interesting when we we talked about how to better rank our team members', 'I found the concept of the project interesting', 'Citation part was also interesting', 'I think this will be a very enjoyable project', 'It was interesting to learn about the Taum Sauk reservoir', 'I found the correct way to constructively critisize a teamate interesting', 'The building process of something so impactful as a hydroelectric dam', 'I liked discussing the hydro electric power', 'I really enjoyed the team discussion periods', 'Learning about the reservoir and the Sauk project', 'I found the team evaluation interesting', 'I really enjoy the concept of the dam and what has happened to it', 'I found learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir to be the most interesting', 'I found hydroelectric power very interesting', 'I found the overview on how dams work to be interesting', 'The hydroelectric Sam video was informative', 'I enjoyed learning about hydroelectric power sources', 'Taum sauk', 'I found the informatjon about the Taum Sauk Reservoir most interesting', 'the upper taum samk reservoir is a failure', 'I think the most interesting thing was how the taum sauk reservoir worked', 'learning about the Reservoir', 'It was interesting to learn about hydroelectric generators', 'I really enjoyed learning more about hydroelectric dams and how they work', 'Information about how a hydroelectric dam works', 'How much data is in the Taum Sauk dataset', 'The citation format, I felt, was important', 'Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting', 'The most interesting thing about todays class was starting a new project', 'I’m excited to start a new project', 'I think it will be a fun task finding the volume', 'hydroelectric power was very interesting', 'I found the reasons for using hydroelectric power to be interesting', 'I found studying the reservoir very interesting', 'just being able to research and find out how hydropower generators work', 'I really enjoyed the breakout rooms', 'the Taum Sauk Reservoir disaster', 'The most interesting part of today’s class was working with my teammates', 'I found that working on assignment 10 was interesting as we were navigating a new project', 'The thing I found most interesting in today’s class was the video on hydroelectric power', 'Hydroelectric power generation was cool to get to understand', 'the models and calculation that will be incorporated for the group project', 'I think this whole project is very interesting', 'the new project assigned was interesting', 'I enjoyed researching the Taum Saul reservoir', 'I think that the new project we are working on is very interesting', 'the differences btw the dam and run of water hydro power', 'the Taum Sauk reservoir is a very interesting structure']"
Hailey,ENGR131_S015,4,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I am still very confused on Assignment 3
I found everything discussed in class today to be clear. The pacing was not too fast and the detail for upcoming assignments was understandable.
I think that what our expectations for work in our groups should be more clearly laid out I was not entirely sure how to approach working when we only had individual assignments.
The Bike Share assignment is still very confusing because it appears like there is very limited information for us to analyze and find problems with. Especially the first part of the Technical Brief seems to have very few instructions
Today’s class was clear and doesn’t need more details currently, but Excel has been problematic with saving and saying I need to sign in while I am already signed in.
The most confusing part was just the required EGO meetings and how to access them along with minimum requirements.
I didn’t have anything confusing for this time.
I feel that everything presented in this class was pretty straight forward. I was a little confused about some of the assignment due dates, but the email sent out cleared it up.
getting used to finding the assignments on brightspace and where to submit them!
Nothing except the number of assignments and when they are due.
This isn’t directly related to today’s lecture, but I’m still confused on the different data types and determining the data types of different data. I would appreciate if we reviewed this concept further.
I think just adjusting to brightspace and getting used to finding and submitting assignments on there can be confusing.
Todays class was very good. I was not confused about anything.
Some more tips for creating chart titles could be useful.
In today's class i found everything to be straightforward and nothing confusing
I felt as though I had a good understanding of everything that went on in the class. However, I would have liked to look at more examples of good problem statements.
Needed more details about each assignment.
I liked that we went over problem statements more. I think it would’ve been helpful if we would’ve been presented with a client memo and then had to come up with a problem statement for that memo as a class. I think more in class examples similar to our assignments would be phenomenal.
Describing the engineering specific sessions and how they worked was very confusing and not thouroughly explained, however I am assuming that it will be explained in detail more in the future
For the most part everything was pretty clear. I might need to reference back to the slides to figure out what chart to use where but other than that I am good.
Today’s class was good, it was easy to follow
N/A
I would have liked there to be more information about the differences between the individual and team technical brief assignment
I thought everything was very straight forward and just the right amount of time.
I was confused on if there is a definite way to tell what type of graph to use.
One thing that could’ve used more details would be how to determine what type of chart to use.
Details about certain assignments.
I found that parts of assignment A06 were slightly confusing
Nothing at all!!","In this lecture, students were most confused about assignment specifics such as due dates and expectations for group work. Students also mentioned confusion about determining the type of chart to use and differentiating data types.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,2,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"I found it interesting to learn how to convert files to excel in practicality. Though this aspect was also slightly confusing, contrasting with both the practice modules and the instructional video given, finding this out was helpful and I feel like I learned a new skill.
I liked the discussion groups we were broken up into. They were really helpful in getting to know other classmates and to collaborate with them
I found the development of the problem statement very interesting as well as the way in which we analyzed the data we were given. I am looking forward to continuing the bike share project!
Working on the Problem Statement for the project with other people.
Nothing specifically, but I did have fun.
I like the dynamics of the class. The breakout rooms are great and the assignments engaging.
CoGo’s data was very interesting. Seeing all the ID necessary to track all the bikes and locations as well as time stamps was interesting.
Learning to use basic functions in Excel was interesting, but I was confused if there was a certain approach we were supposed to take.
I have never used excel before so it’s features were new and interesting. The magnitude of the numbers in the complex calculations were surprising.
I found the process of making the statements interesting
How useful the Excel is. I used the different way to get the same answer for the practice question. And I love to chat with peer and solve problems together.
Using the POWER term in excel to say a number that is raised to a certain power.
I really enjoyed looking at the data in class today!
I thought interpreting the CoGo data was interesting because our team was using everybody’s ideas and input.
I liked talking about the flaws of the CoGo Bike Share with my teammates because we found different things that could be fixed.
what was most interesting today during class to me was the excel data from GoCo bike share.
I found discussing the data and the problem statement with my group to be the most interesting. It was interesting to hear my group discuss the data and what they found there.
In today’s class, I enjoyed our discussions when we were tasked with creating an equation to compute the gravitational force. My group mates came up with interesting approaches to the problem.
I like to use excel and interpreting data is always fun. You can find some really odd relationships that might be unintuitive but add a lot of insight to the problem.
One thing I found most interesting in today’s class was how excel can be utilized to solve complex problems.
I really enjoyed the breakout rooms and discussing with my peers.
I found writing the problem statement to be most interesting.
How to use Excel.
What I found interesting was how vast of a source of data we will be working with for the bike share project
I found interesting the way Excel lets you do calculations.
I am very new to Excel, so it was interesting to work with the software a little bit today. Also, being around new peers was interesting because I was able to witness the other students’ thought process.
The problem statement was most interesting because we got to start the project.
I enjoyed the breakout activities a lot. They were very engaging and challenging.
learning how to do the complex formula in excel. it was new to me and i enjoyed being able to pick it up quickly

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,3,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I am still unclear about where we can find further information for the problem statement in our final project.
Nothing. Everything was clear. The directions for the breakout groups was not rushed and I was able to discuss the data from the graph with my group mates
For the most part I understood a lot of the information in todays class, especially with the excel stuff. The only main confusing part was when we were discussing the different versions of average, but I was able to figure out why some of my answers in the poll were wrong during our class discussion. Also for the in person assignment I was confused as to what data we were using for the birthyear outlier activity, but my team helped me figure that out too. Other than that everything else went pretty well. I am excited to learn more during the next class.
I didn’t understand what people were saying about the tech brief assignment. I saw someone in the chat saying the due date was pushed back, however, I didnt receive any announcement of that.
The details of the in-class assignments. We need more time to view instructions. would be nice if slides were posted before class.
What exactly the perimeters are for in class assignments
Requirements for spreadsheet submission were a little confusing because I wasn't sure if we needed to somehow highlight or notate the outliers.
what was due and what we were suppose to be doing. no supervision or someone to ask
I did not find anything particularly confusing or unclear this class
I think where to find our assignments, when they are due, what we have to do when is confusing.
At this point, the things I have the most issue with are basic technical things. I never did much with Excel or computers in high school, so saving and submitting is challenging occasionally.
Figuring out how to properly work excel is confusing.
The Excel outlier/pivot table part of the class was sort of confusing however it was cleared up once we did the breakout rooms
The time for the in class activity is very short. I would like the assignments due dates to be more easily accessible as this information is confusing.
I did not know how to make a scatter graph with acceptable bounds on excel.
The thing that I struggled with the most was just navigating Excel. I don’t have a whole lot of experience with it, so it is going to take some practice to get the hang of it.
The file uploads should be clarified as well as updates to previous assignments.
Confused about what we needed to display in the excel document for the in class activity.
I was confused on what was supposed to be submitted to the bright space assignment that was done in class.
There are many numbers relating to different assignments that sometimes it is hard to keep straight about which ones are due.
Deadlines

The in-class activity was slightly confusing as to what the instructions were and what was wanted in the assignment.
What exactly we are doing when we go into breakout rooms
I was confused on how to make a pivot table and then convert it into a graph.
The bike share project details. There wasn't really much that was mentioned, and the requirements look foreign.
The exact dates of assignments and what assignments we should be working on isn’t the most clear during the lectures.
I would’ve appreciated if we spent more time discussing the assignments and the expectations that you have for each assignment. For example, Assignment A03 was very overwhelming and I would’ve liked someone to go over the expectations for it.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,6,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.
skittles
Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today’s class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram.
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.
Calculating z values
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments
I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
I really like the Skittles assignment.
The different data that we were using to do the skittles project
How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
The use of z-scores
Skittle activity was fun to do.
I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting.
I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring.
I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart.
I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
Skittles are weird
The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics.
Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand.
The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
using Z score chart was the most interesting
I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used.
I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
Histogram uses in excel
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning.
Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together.
The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
Remembering how to do Z-scores
Everything else was Interesting
One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability.
The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table.
I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting!
The breakout rooms were good
I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus.
I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets
The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
The function of the z-score
I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","In this lecture, students were most interested in learning about z-scores, especially the z-score chart. Students were also interested in how to find probabilities using z-scores, histograms, or from real data. Additionally, students enjoyed the Skittles assignmenet and getting to apply concepts to real data. Furthermore, students liked time spent working in teams.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,2,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I was unclear on what the constraints and criteria were intended to be. In the class, as opposed to the practice module, there was no specification given from the point of view of the stakeholder, making the problem statements we generated ambiguous or arbitrary.
Nothing was very confusing. Just some of the slides went by fast so it became a bit hard to follow. For example, when describing how to unzip a file, the instructions went by very quickly and group members were rushing to get it to open on excel
The way in which you open the data in excel. I believe the technique that was shown was not up to date with the way it is done in windows now. There was lots of confusion around that. Everything else was great, thank you!
The differences in data were hard to understand.
I feel some skills were taught after us being put to the task to solve them. I don’t know if this was intentional but it was confusing to me trying to figure them out from little excel understanding (primarily derived from modules 5-10).
I really like the class however it is a little bit confusing when assignments are due or which ones we should be working on. It is a little bit difficult to find the assignments in Brightspace as well.
For the problem statement for CoGo, it didn’t seem as if there were any constraints. Could you please provide us with an example of one for CoGo? Thanks.
It was very confusing what was expected of us when looking through the data file, and I was totally unsure how or even if we were supposed to somehow incorporate that information into the problem statement.
I was having problems with changing the file type into an excel file until the Professor was able to send it out as an excel file. Also some of the zoom features needed explaining.
I think I might need some more help with excel in the future.
Who is the client? Is the person who hiring us to help them solve the problem or the organization use CoGo bike?
Going through the definitions of criteria and needs/requests and how to find where those are in the memo.
Nothing was confusing in today’s lecture. I am only confused on what the next step on assignment A03 is and we need to do that.
Today’s class felt very fast paced. My team and I found ourselves needing more time to complete the work especially while trying to listen and learn.
Are we supposed to solve more than one overall problem with our group during this project? Also, what is the criteria of our project?
I was not confused today in class and followed along very well. thanks
I needed more time to figure out how to work excel and submit the assignments to bright space!
I would appreciate if before we were sent to our breakout rooms there was a little more information on what is expected of us in these rooms.
The specific dropboxes were a bit hard to find and I ended up submitting to the wrong one at first. Maybe typing them in chat so I can look back would help.
One thing that needed a little more detail was how exactly to construct the problem statement, as it relates to the Bike Share problem. I understand that it’s supposed to be an assignment we do with our teams, and that includes the problem statement, but I couldn’t quite wrap my head around how the problem statement guide which was provided in the chat, applied specifically to the bike share problem.
Will there be more information next class as to what you are expecting from the Technical Brief. Also, how long does the “Understand The Bicycle Sharing Program” need to be? Additionally, am I able to send my completed Technical Brief to the Professor or a TA for review before the due date?
Excel confused me at first. I needed a little more time to understand Excel and figure things out.
The dates for completing assignments.
Nothing about today’s class was necessarily confusing, but the only aspect that I would technically determine unclear would be how to work excel. I have some experience with excel, however not to the level that it will be used in this class.
I was not 100% clear on the way the constraints and criteria should be worded in the problem statement. Other than that everything was clear.
I felt like everything was explained sufficiently. As long as everyone completed the modules before class, I feel the content should make sense.
How to download the excel data sheet and open it in excel. Also how to do the excel calculation correctly. I haven’t used excel before so the actions are new.
Today’s class was very clear and I do not require any extra help. I feel the file saving types of csv and the excel one may need to be reminded to me and other students.
downloading and opening the excel file was a bit confusing
I was only slightly confused in today’s class. I just don’t really know what I’m doing sometimes.
The only difficult thing for me was to figure out how to do formulas in Excel.","In this lecture, students found working with excel and opening data in it most confusing.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,6,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained
How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
Nothing was confusing today during class
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I wasn’t really confused today
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
Nothing, class was great as usual
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I am not sure about exactly what z value does
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
Nothing really
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail.
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate.
Nothing was confusing for me
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I’m still not sure what it determines.
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
nothing, everything was clear today
Data types
One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing.
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
What we had to do in class
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","In this lecture, students were confused about the instructions for Assignment 8, especially how to address the missing data. Some students also struggled with Assignment 5. Furthermore, students expressed confusion about how to find and use z-scores and what they meant. Students also think they would benefit from more practice with probability.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today’s class?,"A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture.
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content.
during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing.
One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout?
I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms are found to be somewhat confusing.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help.
I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it.
Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users.
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
Nothing was really confusing about today’s class.
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups.
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples.
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.
Test
Everything made sense.
nothing was really confusing in today’s class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms.
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
Under flow and over flow
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them.
Some of the histogram stuff was fast
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources.
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments.
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
Details about which graphs to use when.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well.
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.","In this lecture, many students were confused about the difference between data types like categorical and numerical, ordinal and nominal, and discrete and continuous. Many students also expressed confusion about how to format histogram bins properly. Additionally, some students were confused about how to make a histogram in general; students particularly noted that they’d like more instruction on how to construct histograms in Excel on Mac. A few students wanted more clarification on what graph to use to represent certain data types. Some also expressed that they didn’t have enough time to fully understand the material.","Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around. I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac. Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,1,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"I found the idea of having us represent our depictions of what engineers do and where they work an intriguing way to find our understandings of what engineers actually do.
I found the teaching team to be interesting, I like the concept of having multiple TA’s or peer teachers to help us out.
I think it’s very interesting how we’re going to be doing projects based on real word scenarios because I think it will better prepare us for being engineers.
Today’s class was absolutely amazing and I clearly understood the material/what is to be expected out of the course. Also, I found the presentation very descriptive and detailed, which was helpful in learning more about ENGR 131.
I found it interesting the different perspectives people have on engineering as a whole.
Meeting with the breakout groups was very interesting because I was able to meet new people and find a commonality between us.
I really liked both of the activities in the breakout rooms and interacting with my fellow classmates! I liked to get to know the course a little bit better and learn what is expected of me.
I found the small “breakout” rooms really interesting because it gives me a better chance to actually communicate with a small group of people rather than the roughly 100 students on the Zoom call.
In todays class I found interesting the fact that we would learn to replicate real life situations engineers go through.
The engineer drawing poll was very interesting because of the stereotypes it revealed.
Instead of talking about hmw right away you explained the course which was good and is very understanding.
I really like the idea of teaming up with my peers to solve these problems, and the introduction made me pretty excited to have a class focusing entirely on engineering. I've never worked in a group made of just engineers before and I think it'll be fun.","In this lecture, students really enjoyed working in breakout rooms with other engineering students and learning about what the course structure and teaching staff would be.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,9,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I was somewhat confused by some of the problems in assignment 10, but I worked through it with my group by the end of the class. For example, we were struggling to get the slope demonstrated in the slides.
I found the approach to modeling in A10 very confusing after class. After clearing it up with the professor and doing some experimenting on my own, I cleared it up.
It was confusing how to calculate the volume with given data.
I was not confused today.
Proper was to calculate the surface area to find volume
I felt that everything in today’s class was explained in detail so I had no trouble
I thought that the most difficult aspect of today’s class was graphing regression, although it was not difficult. Class was supposed simple today.
The assignments are very vague. The individual assignments are pretty straightforward but the team ones are super confusing sometimes.
Nothing was confusing today, we had a lot of good work time during class
More details on the quiz could have been beneficial.
I was confused about A10 still and would've liked a little more time spent around the assignment and a further explanation on the volume flow rate. Also i would like to have some time to get some feedback on common missed points on the ICQ1.
The linear regression slides were very confusing to me however after doing the excel activity it is straightforward and i understand the concepts taught
The overall approach to the reservoir's laminar approach was confusing, especially with the example of the graph and trendline. It was a bit vague.
I'm confused as to if we're going to be using the regression equations at all and if we're going to need to remember them, or if this is just to give us background information as to how Excel performs linear regression.
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.
The reservoir models were a little confusing, but after practicing I was able to figure it out and my team was able to explain it to me.
I found the article explanation regarding the ""Reservoir volume to height relationship"" confusing, and more specifically on how it was obtained or found. I also found the SSE and SST explanations a bit confusing, as to what they indicate.
Something that was confusing was the individual regression terms such as SSE. I think a more in depth explanation of those terms would help students understand the concepts, even if we have watched the video modules and taken the quizzes.
There wasn’t anything that was confusing or needed more details in today’s class. The information about the regression equation and excel was explained very well and clarified what we learned through the modules.
In general, I learned how to manipulate and produce the trendline and the r^2 in excel, but do we need to know how to actually produce this values manually for engr 131? Or are we just going to learn that in engr 132?
I did not clearly understand how SSE and r^2 are useful in the calculations we need to complete.
What we were supposed to do in the first time slot was confusing because we didn’t know if there was more for us to do because we had so much time.
My team uses excel online for all of us to work on the workbook, you explained very well on creating regression models on excel, but could you explain how to do it on online version. Thank you.
I believe the section that was confusing was the part relating to the general slopes for the shape assumptions. It was a little confusing since there is no definitive way to get an answer in that ballpark if the shapes were different.
Nothing at all! My team had a few questions regarding Assignment 10; however our TA was extremely helpful and cleared up our confusion. 😊
During the class what was unclear were some questions of the assignments but the clearly were answered by the TA.
I did not understand exactly what concepts the second quiz would cover.
I might need alittle help on the r^2 because it was alittle confusing
I found the equations used for some of the calculations slightly confusing.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
what i found confusing in todays lecture was what the in class assignment was on. I was confused on what exactly i had to complete. Usually the instructions are posted in chat but they were not this time which was slightly confusing.
I thought that the relationship of the data points based off of the r^2 value was a little confusing in assignment 11.
Nothing was confusing
I thought that the there should have been more of an explanation on what is needed to make a linear regression model.
Regression could have been explained more. We could have learned more about the uses and different types and areas.
Nothing
At first I still found the laminar approach and regression ideas to be confusing, but by the end it was less confusing.
We could have gone over the laminar approach more because the regression line information seemed pretty easy to understand based on the module videos.
I am confused about the r value and the r^2 value. I watched the modules and after class I am still confused. What does r represent? How do you find it?
The video module we watched before class was very overwhelming, it was just throwing information our way that was hard to interpret
Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was would you have to show a trend line if the graph is already linear or do you just state that the equation of the line is the best estimate?
I was confused on what to do with the equation and r squared value on the chart.
Information about the exam.
A11 was annoying because we had to manually import the data. it was necessarily confusing but it was tedious and I know all of us wasted 5 minutes on it.
Nothing was very confusing in today’s class.
This class wasn’t confusing at all!
assignment 11
I still struggle with how exactly to comprehend a line of regression and what SSE and SST are meant to display.
Nothing was confusing for today
not much this class because this class was really straight forward so i understood most things
I thought that assignment 10 was slightly confusing in regard to the mathematical modeling and what exactly was needed.
More explanation about project A10 and the models would be helpful. It is a bit confusing with creating graphs and knowing if it is correct.
What will be covered in Exam 1
The measurements to use in A10 seem confusing because nothing is explicitly stated, though it’s something that can be easily worked around.
Nothing really everything was straight forward
How to estimate the R^2 values just by looking at a scatter plot
Everything was straight forward in today’s lecture
Nothing was very confusing about todays class.
Nothing was very confusing today, I am familiar with trend lines.
How exactly we formulated our models in assignment 10, the instructions did not specify how free reign the assignment actually was. thankfully the pts cleared that up for us.
Nothing was confusing today, the class went pretty well. One issue I had though was getting some help in breakouts, but no TA’s came by.
nothing was really confusing today. everything was very easy to understand in my opinion
no confusion
there was nothing today that was confusing
Nothing really shockingly confusing today. Just more of a work day
Nothing was confusing in today’s class.
I wish we had more details about the laminar approach and how we could apply it to our A10 assignment.
What the purpose of the trend line and the r squared value is in relation to our project
I’m a little confused about the r squared value in comparison to the line of best fit.
nothing was confusing really, everything worked out smoothly
There wasn’t really anything too confusing in today’s class.
Today’s lecture was very detailed and there are no topics needing extra explanation.
The group assignment.","In this lecture, students had the most confusion surrounding r-squared and linear regression. Students also were confused about A10 and A11 as well as details surrounding the exam/quiz.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,7,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn’t much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.
Everything explained was clear.
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
N/A
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
Nothing
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
I am confused how the laminar approach works.
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this.
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources.
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
How to search for data quickly.
The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained.
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful.
I didn't find anything confusing today.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
I was confused on parts of assignment A10
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
nothing
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific.
how to use the outside resources information in the research
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","In this lecture, students were confused about how to complete assignment A10. Additionally and more specifically, students were confused by how to use the Laminar approach and how to employ mathematical models in this assignment. Similarly, students were confused about how to complete the in-class activity and what was being asked; some needed more time. Students also had questions about how to find and cite reliable sources and what sources are acceptable for use. Finally, students wanted more background on the Taum Sauk reservoir and how hydroelectric dams work in general.","i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is. What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions. There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.","['I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth', 'I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity', 'I needed a little more info on in text citations', 'It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project', 'We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach', 'The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source', 'How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information', 'The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity', 'I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models', 'Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand', 'I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help', 'Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases', 'What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity', 'The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing', 'I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward', 'especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project', 'I am confused how the laminar approach works', 'The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing', 'hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10', 'I was confused around the in class activity', 'The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been', 'I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class', 'I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10', 'I needed more time to do the in class assignment', 'what a laminar approach is.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done.
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself.
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
The histogram plotting and the activity A07
I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
Test
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.
I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting.
I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
Learning more about my breakout group
The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram.
The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.
I found it interesting how to use a histogram
I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
The in class activity
I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","In today's lecture, students were most interested in histograms, including how to make and utilize them and some of their general properties. Students also enjoyed learning about what charts to use to represent different variables and data types the best. Additionally, students liked working with their groups and interacting with the class in general. Furthermore, students found the in-class activity (assignment 7) very helpful. Finally, students felt that they were getting better at using Excel, and class helped clarify some of their problems.",I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,8,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"Something that I personally thought needed more detail in today’s class was the explantations and reasoning behind the equations that some students and the teacher came up with for the geometric shapes.
To get the best result, I was confused of which value I should use.
I found some of the concepts slightly underdeveloped with regards the the complications involved in our calculations for this project
How do we approximate the surface area at various depths without information on the geometry of the reservoir?
I thought that the instructions for the mathematical models were misleading. The slides and our TA cleared that up and clarified to just use 2D shapes.
The power equation was kind of confusing. I was mostly confused on how to find each variable, however, I am not sure if this equation will be utilized later in the course.
I thought that I might need alittle help with setting up the mathematic models
I was confused as to how exactly the shaper perimeter activity was relevant to the design project. Even though it was a mathematical model, it didn't help me to understand how to go about finding the mathematical model in the project.
How to do the mathematical model in A10. I was struggling on figuring out how to do it and I just couldn’t figure it out. I asked on how to do it but something about after 8ft made it very confusing.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to calculate the Ph if we did not know where the pipes were attached based on the total depth of the upper reservoir.
What was confusing was when we went into our breakout rooms the first time. My group was confused on how to calculate Ph and what the other variables meant in the power formula.
I am still slightly confused on how to turn our physical models into mathematical ones in assignment 10.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was the Laminar Flow structure and how one would go about structuring that in an excel sheet. This includes what information to include in each row and how to detail that information for whoever may be looking at the document.
Modeling was slightly confusing for what shapes to use and when to use them.
I may have just missed it, however, I did find it confusing how to use the percent grade to calculate the height of the pipe in the in class activity. Nevertheless, one of the PT guys was able to clear this up and help me with the issue. I was just making it too complicated.
At first, function that models the volume of the upper reservoir was confusing, but that was easily cleared up once I made system of equations and modeled each layer individually.
The thing that was confusing today was trying to figure out a mathematical model that fit the slope change of the reservoir. It was confusing because it is difficult to picture a function that would map all of this information.
Something that could’ve used more detail for me, was the explanation how what we are doing in class associates with our assignment number 10.
The general equation for power was not really explained what each component meant. Also, the equation for pressure also account for shape and not just height, but based on some of the questions in A10 we will get into that a bit more.
You could've talked more more about different ways to find mathamatical models other than imputing into excel graph.
During the in class assignment, I found it difficult to find what we were supposed to do. The instructions in step two, combined with the equation on the bottom left of the PowerPoint slide made it difficult to decipher what needed to be done and how.
For the difference between the upper and lower reservoirs, my team debated about if the height included the upper reservoir height, and concluded it didn’t. We then found out it did and were confused as to why.
How did you get the height of the water in your answer to the in class participations section.
There was an issue with the in class activity where it wasn't specified of the displacement in vertical height directly infrastructure of the turbine was included in our calculation. I was confused and asked the Ta to figure it out
I thought that the volumetric measurements needed a little more clarification. I understand the basics of it, however perhaps some more examples would hav helped.
The definition of the laminar approach, and explanation assignment 10
Creating models was definitely confusing and could use more explanations in the future. I felt like I need additional guidance finding the best approach when trying to create a model and how to improve models to make it the best possible.
I didn’t know if we were supposed to include the depth of the upper reservoir in our total Ph. I did anyway, and the people in my group did as well. Besides that everything was pretty straightforward.
The assignment a10 was confusing at first but we did manage to start to understand it when Jeff came into our breakout room
It was unclear how to make mathematical models in terms of the data from the Taum Sauk reservoir. My team and I discussed though and we have an approach.
It was confusing what our 2 models were actually supposed to be for A10. I also felt like we could have been given a little more helping in understanding how to calculate the volume of the reservoir at each section
In today’s lecture I didn’t find anything super confusing is just that I always run out of them on the in class assignments, I don’t have enough time to complete them in class and have to complete them after class.
I didn’t quite understand how to complete the in class activity at first because it was explained a little confusing but I got it later after our TA helped more, so it would’ve been better if it was explained more initially.
we were confused about what the document was saying and so if the instructions on the document can be more clear it would be better
The laminar approach to the mathematical model of the Taum Sauk reservoir needed a little more description. I got the basic idea but I did not know where to start with implementing it to my technical brief.
How to use a laminar approach and the how to figures out the different mathematical equations
The method for getting the length of the slope of the inclined pipe was confusing.
The discussion on modeling was a bit confusing, as we discussed what models were and did a few examples, but we didn’t really talk about their importance.
We needed more slides available to us while we were completing the in class assignment. It would have helped with our calculations.
Originally, I was confused on how to do the participation assignment but that was fixed with the help of my group
I am still a little confused on the Laminar Approach.
The whole idea of laminar approach was a little confusing to me, so I am grateful that the class is recording so I can review that a little more.
How does the quation work
The laminar approach was somewhat confusing, I wish we went over that a little more
I again felt that the assignment 10 was confusing, but less so than last class as the instructions became more clear.
Nothing really needed more details during the class. Maybe just a clearer outline on those after class meetings we are supposed to go to.
I didn’t find anything too confusing.
I was a little confused on creating the equation for the perimeter of the two shapes.
It would be helpful to have more details about the reservoir models and how to calculate them
I was confused on if the 92 feet should be added to the P calculation.
The models are pretty difficult to understand and I think we went through them too quickly.
I would’ve appreciated if we went over the laminar approach in more depth. It was unclear what our excel file should look like.
The Taum Sauk project
I didn’t understand what we are doing the the mathematical models.
How to complete the in class activity.
The dimensions of the reservoir.
Nothing
Everything was clarified for me by PT-Alan Pistone
how to find the answer to the in class participation assignment
nothing was confusing
I was a little confused on when Assignment 10 is due because on Brightspace it says it’s due before class 5A. However, the date shows September 25th, which is the date for class 5B.
Nothing in this class was confusing or needs more details.
I did not completely understand how we would create the mathematical models for the project mentioned.","In this lecture, students mentioned the most confusion around the Taum Salk reservoir activity. They struggled with developing mathematical models and working with the laminar approach and power equation. Students also had general confusion about A10 details and the participation activity.","Creating models was definitely confusing and could use more explanations in the future.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,8,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"I found it very interesting that you are able to find an equation for perimeter that applies for both shapes without having to adjust for each.
It was interesting that I can get estimate value of a stuff in real life with mathematical way.
I really enjoy the progression to more group time
leaning how to model the perimeter of geometric shapes.
I thought that coming up with a model for the reservoir was interesting and provided an enjoyable challenge, because it requires some creative thinking.
I found the part where we were applying the power equation and information to the Taum Sauk project with our group interesting
I found it interesting how we could fins the distance between the resvoirs
I found it interesting how we would need to use the vertical cross section in order to determine the change in the horizontal cross section.
I found interesting the layering methods we are using because level curves seems to be more accurate.
What I found interesting about today’s class was how there are so many different models to depict a system.
What was most interesting was learning about the laminar model and how it differs from others.
Going over simple examples of how to use the laminar approach
The thing I found most important in today’s class is that the mathematical model doesn’t have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.
The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.
I found it interesting that engineers use units like feet-acres which seem very unusual at a first glance, but actually have a really useful meaning in the real world.
I found the modeling of the reservoir volume interesting since it required me to use some of my skills learned from calculus and other math classes to solve.
The most interesting thing in today’s class was learning about the drop in altitude between the two reservoirs because I thought it was interesting that the gap was so large.
When we learned about the laminar approach, that was the most interesting to me.
I really like this project idea. I've modeled a coal-fired generator as a rankine cycle before in my thermodynamics class, and this project seems to be really similar.
I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft.
Though everything was already covered by the modules that were required to be completed prior to class, I found it intriguing how the different models show different information and in different ways.
I was making charts about the different relationships between volumes of the upper lower and total reservoirs and found their relationships interesting
I found the different ways that values can be approximated to be a cool challenge.
how useful laminar models can be
I found nothing interesting in class. Being Friday, I was very exhausted and uninterested. However, I will study the topics from class later tonight to get a better understanding of the material.
The ability to model anything mathematically
The in-class activity was really important I thought because it was a good “stepping stone” into project 2 and assignment a10.
I really like statistics and I enjoyed using my calculator to input data and create formulas to represent data. I also did some research on the Taum Sauk reservoir which was fun.
I really like this project, i find the concept of us working on a real world problem excites me because it helps give incite into what our future is going to look like
I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting. Creating these mathematical models will be fun for me.
Excel can be used to create this relationship between volume and water height in the reservoir. I also didn’t realize at first that you have to adjust your volume formula based on the slope when u go deeper. I was assuming that it was just a straight vertical line to the bottom.
The most interesting part of today’s class was investigating for the assignment 10 project and learn more about hydroelectric power.
I thought it was great when we were working with our team members. It really helped me understand better.
we were able to work together again in breakout rooms and so that was good interaction
I found the laminar approach to be the most confusing and the most interesting part of the lecture today. It’s like a three dimensional application of Riemann sums.
How use it is to develop an equation to solve for/simply complex data or problems
I found the formula for the power of the reservoir interesting.
I enjoyed working with my team in studio time today to work on assignment 10.
I found it interesting that Reservoirs can be so complex. And that so many different types of engineers are needed in order to create such a reservoir.
The group time was plenty of time for my group to be efficient and work on assignment 10
I found the part of the lecture where you explained Part 4 to be interesting because I started to understand it better
I found calculating the pressure head interesting because I had trouble doing that in high school and now it is a little more familiar, so it was fun to practice that again.
building a mathematical model to solve questions.
I found the Pressure head calculation applications interesting
I thought the laminar approach to modeling was interesting as I had never heard of it before and it made a lot of sense to me.
This class didn’t interest me too much. Just learning nee stuff seemed cool and was good to get in.
It was very interesting how to calculate the power of the reservoirs
I found the additional research on the project my team did today very interesting.
It was very interesting to start brainstorming ideas and shapes for our models.
I really liked learning how we solve for P and how to represent something mathematically.
I enjoyed the in class activity, it was different to what we have been doing in the last few classes
I enjoyed learning about modeling. It’s fun to try and predict and create equations for different circumstances.
Modeling
Once I can fully understand the concept of outlet models I will find it more interesting
The information about modeling.
The size of the reservoir and how it was best used.
Its reallly hard to approximate taum sauks volume
The laminar approach for estimating volume
creating models for a situation
getting the volume for the reservoir
Today’s class was great and I ended up getting a lot of work done with my team! I enjoyed the in class activity and learned a lot about the Taum Sauk reservoir. The presentation was very clear and the TAs were helpful.
The class in all was very interesting
It was interesting to see the way mathematical models can be used to represent many things.","In this lecture, students found calculating power in the Taum Salk reservoir activity to be very interesting. They also enjoyed learning about mathematical modeling and the Laminar approach to it. Students also enjoyed spending time working in groups and the over-all real world application of the lecture content.","The thing I found most important in today’s class is that the mathematical model doesn’t have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,1,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"A more detailed explanation of when and where the assignments are assigned and submitted. I noticed on Brightspace that there were resources for the assignments, but found it difficult to distinguish how it would be submitted.
The lecture was good, It contained a lot of information about the course structure, and how the semester will go. I would’ve liked a little more information about the structure of the group projects but I’m assuming that will come when we start them.
I’m a little bit confused about how much of this class will be in person, for example details like will we be meeting outside of our class with our groups in person.
I was wondering if it was required to submit a reflection on this app after each class? Or, do we just submit a reflection if we have questions/concerns? Thank you!
I found nothing too confusing in today’s class.
The power shutdown so I was unable to view the second half of the lecture.
Everything was pretty clear. I would’ve liked to go a little more in depth into what we are going to be doing in the various different projects, but I’m guessing that will be explained when the time is right.
I think the majority of today’s class was very clear, especially when regarding the overall course structure for this semester. l think most of my personal confusion came with the actual software we’ll be using, but that will get better as I become more familiar with such programs.
After today’s lecture, I was left unaware of when and how exactly would we get together in groups to work on the assigned projects.
It was unclear to me whether or not we would have the same group for the entire semester based on the survey we will be taking.
I don't think there was anything confusing or more detail.
Everything was explained pretty clearly, I think I just need to get used to online courses. The technology issues did make the lecture a bit bogged down.","In this lecture, students were mostly confused about the structure of assignments and group projects.

I liked the topic about the eym and how to go about choosing our major. For me I’m still undecided so this was very helpful for me to know and when the deadlines are
I found that working with exel was surprisingly efficient in generating useful graphs.
I thought the distinction between graph types was really important, especially the example provided between the line and scatter graph since I guessed wrong. It’s definitely something I’ll use often in this class and in my future occupation
I appreciated the overview and example of a problem statement that was given in class.
The different graphs to indicate cross-sections was pretty interesting. I saw one of them but the other was completely unique
The team project was interesting
I found it interesting how we have the events to explore the different schools of engineering. I think this part of the course will be very beneficial and I am excited to learn about the different areas.
The group time was very helpful and it was the perfect amount of time to get things done!
The meetings with the different engineering colleges will be an interesting experience and it is nice that we aren’t constrained for the last meeting.
In today’s class, I enjoyed discussing the different chart types and their purpose. I enjoy discussing these things with my classmates and the professor.
I found working with my team for an extended period of time to be most interesting.
The most interesting thing about todays class was learning about when to use the different graphs and charts on excel and how to change them.
I like the idea of reviewing all the engineering disciplines to see what might interest us.
i found it interesting to work with my groups on the assignments that we have due in the upcoming week.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was the usage of different graphs based on the provided data.
The graphs that showed what engineering path students took.
Going over the due dates was helpful.
I liked the difference between the graphs part of the presentation.
I thought the opportunities we are going to have to explore other fields of engineering were very interesting.
The eym part
Spending time near the end of class to speak with our team to work on assignments.
I liked working in the studio time with my group, we were very productive
The transition to major statistics I thought were quite interesting.
I really enjoyed learning more about how to format charts on excel.

Hailey,ENGR131_S015,3,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"Learning how to apply various filters and manipulate pivot tables was very informative and will probably be useful in completing the Bikeshare assignment.
I really liked getting to know who my group is and getting to talk with them about our project.
The most interesting part about class today was learning more about the excel functions. It helped having the teacher explain again what the functions in excel were and how to use pivot tables and filters and stuff, even after watching the videos before.
I liked to finally get to know my team. Its easier to develop a relationship with a dew people than bounce back and forth between people on different classes.
how useful excell can be
Meet the people in my group, and finding out about them
It was interesting to see how average has very different meanings depending on context.
being in teams
I found it interesting to finally meet the members of my group.
I found it interesting how to find outliers in the data.
I enjoyed the teamwork aspect of class today, as well as the problem analysis with the soap dispenser. Talking about why something works poorly, how to improve it, and how that applies to the engineering thought process are fun for me.
Meeting my group member was the most interesting.
it was interesting to learn about the other people in my group
I enjoyed the video and the class discussions afterwards. It would be interesting to do this type of things with my team members in order to understand their points of view.

The most interesting part of class for me was getting to meet my teammates. It was interesting to get to know everyone and figure out what everyone is planning to do.
Most handless soap dispensers use IR sensors because they are cheaper than something like an ultrasonic sensor.
the different situations in which mean, median, and mode were applied as the average.

Seeing excel do the things that it can do like actually making the pivot charts
It was good that the importance of diversity and acceptance was stressed in this class.
Meeting with our new breakout groups who we will he meeting with the rest of the semester
I enjoyed learning how to apply filters to data.
The details about our next projects and how engineering needs to take many possible scenarios into account.

assignment A06
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.

The start of the second part of A06 is very confusing because it is completely new.
What was confusing in class today was the logical operator xor and felt like it could used some more detail since and and or operators are more common throughout programming.
The bin_no and the count_bin question on the in class activity was hard to understand. Particularly because we could not execute it in matlab to cross check our answers and we had relational and logical operators to deal with for the first time.
I think there should be more about logical list. As how we can use them and how it worked. Also, I think it would be better to talk about some previous homework.

I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
The explanations of the cross product were very informative, and the practice problems really helped to clarify the topic
I thought today’s lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could’ve used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question.
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions.
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen).

the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could’ve been covered and used in examples more
i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i’ll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth
The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it’s pointing in or out of the screen.

The thing that I found confusing in today’s lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn’t aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help.
I thought today’s lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that.
The cross product was a little confusing because I didn’t know where to apply it in terms of physics.

The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I find circular motion interesting because to me it just clicks in how to properly carry out a problem.

I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
I found centripetal force interesting today because I learned more about it than I did from the videos.
The most interesting thing in today’s lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane. It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .

I found the discussion about Pokémon and the exam format to be most interesting
The references to Pokémon and the references to Minecraft and how jumping into little to no water doesn’t kill you
I would say how you can use the drag force and terminal velocity and use them together like done in the water/air plane jump problem.
The real life applications to problems, increasing the time it takes for a collision to occur sets up energy stuff pretty well.

Alex,PHYS0174,2,,"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Today’s lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn’t work, and I needed to subtract 360°.
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.
I didn’t find anything confusing or unclear during today’s class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I’m very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material.
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos.
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out
Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
I thought today’s class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
I am familiar with vectors which was the topic of the lecture. I thought the professor gave enough details for me.
There was nothing that proved to be confusing or unclear in today’s class.
There wasn’t anything really confusing about today’s lecture. I had a little trouble with the top hat questions however I seemed to get the hang of it by the end. I liked that the teacher drew the graphs and vectors.
I was confused by the question about the atoms whose positions were represented by vectors stemming from the same origin. The idea of vectors representing positions led me to believe it was a collision problem so I struggled to set it up.
When values should be positive or negative and when it is necessary to add 180 to an angle.
I’m confused about the direction a negative vector points when it is added to a positive vector.
I didn’t find anything that was confusing. The content videos before the lecture were very helpful for preparing.
Vectors are very confusing to me. They were explained very well, I just have issues understanding how to start the problems and use the equations with the information given.
When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in
I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct. How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction?
Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format.
Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
Today’s video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help.
How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them.
There was nothing confusing to me in today’s lecture.
The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B.
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it.
Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that’s just cause I prefer it that way.
The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
I thought today’s lecture was good. One thing I’d like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn’t already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too?
Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself.
I just don’t understand when we subtract and don’t add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract?
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I’ll get at it.
The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn’t as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after.
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too.
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic.
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
In today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics.
Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven’t used them too much in about a year.
everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you’ll lose points for each attempt.)
The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
Something that was confusing about today’s video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’m not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.
The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Many students still have some questions about vector mathematics. It seems like they still need some practice with it. Some students are also having some issues with TopHat. Again, this might be due to them needing more practice.

Alex,PHYS0174,6,,"FBD
I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton’s Laws. I especially found tension interesting.
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture.
The thing that I found most interesting in today’s lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
The thing I found most interesting in today’s lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases
I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over
I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting.
How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn’t affect tension.
Top hot conceptual questions
Top hat
Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton’s laws.
The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami.
The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine
The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
In today’s video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material
I really enjoyed the tension/Newton’s 3rd Law problems. They’re tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me.
Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems
I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he’s trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
the zero-g examples
I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it’s showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
The reference frames and how they affect things
when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
I found Newton’s first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun.
I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects.
I definitely enjoyed the group work
tension
I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
Using free body diagrams
Working in break out rooms to solve problems
net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized.
I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
Tension and force pairs because I didn’t learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
I found the description of Newton’s Laws of Motion most interesting.
Tension in a rope is the same everywhere
I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity”
I enjoyed learning about Newton’s Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams
An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math.
free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.","Many students enjoyed the top-hat questions, specifically the ones highlighting tension.

Alex,PHYS0174,5,,"Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That’s how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
The top hat question about relative motion
1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday
Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion.
The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn’t understand this setup fully.
Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need.
I thought today’s lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity
The question that could’ve used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It’s just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes.
I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful
I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining.
The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
Relative motion from a moving reference point
Today’s lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
I don’t quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though.
need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems
There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don’t have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn’t included.
I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
more relative motion problems
I have no questions.
relative motion in 2d
I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too.
Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives
The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me
I’m still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components.
I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I’m not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
relative motion in 2-d
The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion.
relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative.
I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can’t understand reference views.
Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
Tension forces
I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.

Alex,PHYS0174,5,,"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component’s velocity is constant, the y component’s velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
The monkey experiment is interesting.
The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today’s lecture because it was different and fun.
The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground.
The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students.
I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school.
I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting.
I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool.
I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem
I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
Calculating 2-D motion
I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
The group questions
The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch.
I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
Monkey problem.
falling monkey
I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems.
Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole
The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating.
I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant
The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent.
The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other.
projectile motion and falling monkey
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
The FBD drawings
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
There’s no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion.","Many students found projectile motion, and specifically the monkey problem, very interesting. Some students also mentioned that they enjoyed TopHat questions in general. There is also some interest in relative motion problems, and working in groups.","Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by thesolution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinatingthat the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it madeimpact right before the monkey hit the ground.   I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives. I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned thatvertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the xcomponent’s velocity is constant, the y component’s velocity is not.  I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students.  I liked the top hat questions.

Alex,PHYS0174,2,,"The format. I’ve never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I’ve also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that’s why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn’t matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow.
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I found adding and subtracting 3 vectors interesting
I thought it was interesting that cos(x) usually applies to the x-axis, but it's relative to your perspective
The fact that with the knowledge of vectors you can identify the force and direction of an object being acted on by multiple forces going in different directions.
I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed
How the vector notations can simplify in multiple dimensions to create either a vector or scalar output.
I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on.
The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it’s nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
The problem prompts were not boring.
How word problems are so easily connected to the topic, and how much easier it is to understand a problem when you draw out the vectors.
I really enjoyed doing the TopHat questions in groups. I enjoyed working with others and it felt good helping others with the problem
I thought it was interesting seeing how, what we learned in the recorded videos, could actually apply to real life situations.
The idea that a yeti cannot determine its way and somehow needs the help of gps technology.
I was able to piece together how to solve the problems we were doing at the end of the lecture and it was satisfying to see myself come to understand how to solve them by the end
I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren’t just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged in practice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
I found it interesting how much the content overlaps what I’m learning in calculus right now.
I like math, so I find setting up vector problems using triangles to be a bit fun.
I thought that the comparison of altering angles vs using trig on the picture as given was interesting. I'd never actually seen them compared side by side before, it was just something implied or glossed over.
I found the idea of applied vectors to real situations helpful and interesting.
I loved how you outlined your teaching style! It was awesome to get insight into how you want to run the class.
The way the theoretical concepts we learned describe real world occurrences like a walking yeti.
I realized that you could add vectors by combining their components.
The thing I found most interesting in today’s video lecture was being able to work in small groups using zoom breakout rooms. This helped me work through the problem because I was able to discuss my ideas and process with others.
The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
I found the puck question the most interesting along with the yeti. They were both thought provoking. I found the puck one really interesting because it gave three vectors to add which made it slightly more challenging.
I thought it was interesting how you could tell which direction something goes based on the angle and force you put on it (hockey problem).
I actually really enjoyed the break out rooms and the top hat problems. It kept class interesting and enjoyable.
I liked the breakout rooms and getting to discuss with classmates as well as the review of the top hat questions and new examples like the yeti problem.
How a calculator can mess up the inverse tangent and the 180 degrees that need to be added. Also, chrono trigger
I found the clicker questions to be the most interesting. I personally prefer the application questions that use actual numbers so I can get live feedback on my work.
I found it interesting that extra credit is offered in this course. This is my only class that offers it. I hope to take advantage of this opportunity (as I am doing now). I also found it interesting that it is easy to ask questions and meet with the TA’s in their office hours.
I was interested in the practice problems. I thought it was interesting because it was neat to apply the problems into something that could come up in real life.
I really enjoyed the hands on parts. Also, I found it interesting how much we are allowed to work in groups
I had already known that force was a vector, but it was cool to me that you could directly treat it like one with regards to adding them (at least with regards to that problem).
Working through the yeti problem was the most helpful/ interesting part for me and it was good to work through more problems.
Definitely telling the difference between when you should add or subtract a vector. That was one of the things I was most confused on during the lecture videos and going over that today helped a lot!
The worked out examples really helped me out. Now I know what I need to focus on to improve.
Drawing pictures as it pertains to what forces are acting on an object.
I really enjoyed the drawings. It can be hard for me to visualize concepts and those helped. They were clear and not too complicated, especially in comparison to many other books and videos.
I liked the breakout rooms and the top hat questions. Not many teachers do in class assessments, and I found it a very interactive way to learn the material.
I now know how to find the resultant of 3 different vectors versus 2.
The addition and specifically subtraction of more than two vectors.
I like using the top hat questions, it’s definitely helpful in keeping engaged and I also liked the breakout rooms
I found the hands on practice very interesting. I would not have found out how well I learned the material from the lecture videos if we had not used Top Hat and the breakout rooms to practice the material.
The most interesting part of today’s video lecture was adding vectors by components. From past physics experience I know this is crucial for later modules.
Question topics (I.e. yeti or hockey game) were just different from just saying like a boy and worked to keep my attention better.
using tophat was interesting
I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson.
The discussion of how there are multiple ways to represent vectors with different notations so problems can look different but ask the same thing.
I found the most interesting part of the lecture was the part about breaking a vector into its components in order to solve.
I found it most interesting in the lecture how you can use trigonometry in order to add vectors and find angle measures.
The most interesting part was the use of triangles to add vectors.

Alex,PHYS0174,10,,"There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult.

Alex,PHYS0174,4,,"How to find acceleration in relative motion in both 1D and 2D
I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
What was a little confusing in today’s lecture was determining which kinematic formula we needed to start with
The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could’ve used another example to help clarify.
The most confusing part of the lecture was the tophat question about the dinosaurs. I didn’t understand why both the accelerations were positive
Going in depth for more problems in class
In today’s lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration.
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don’t remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually.
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
The discussion around direction and sign.
N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today’s lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
I am confused about how we know when to use each kinematic equation.
Honestly I thought today’s lecture was very straight forward and I wasn’t confused that much
average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me
The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could’ve been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could’ve done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”
The confusing part of today’s lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn’t understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn’t seem that bad.
The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer.
The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn’t understand the i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture.
Nothing that we went over was confusing or unclear for me today. I guess that if would’ve been more clear to spend a bit more time on the dinosaur problem. Perhaps going into more detail as to how you obtained the setup for the problem.
Multiple object kinematics
direction of acceleration during circular motion
I didn’t understand the circular motion aspect of today’s lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
There was not much that was confusing I just think I need to have more practice with using the kinematic equations.
I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
Circular motion and how acceleration works with it.
the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained
The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can’t be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn’t be able to work.
During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer.
The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing
The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly
The graphs picturing their difference between average and instantaneous velocity.
The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine.
conceptual questions such as if you can accelerate while at constant speed or where the direction of acceleration would be based on direction of velocity
Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position.
The speed, velocity, and acceleration we talked about towards the end
We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer)
Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics
In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations.
nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts.
The second top hat question regarding two objects colliding. We haven’t been taught/ reviewed how to use kinematics with more than one object
more explanation as to why certain numbers are negative and what makes a velocity/acceleration a negative value
I was confused about filling in the known variables. For example, on the question about how long the ball took until it came back down, I didn’t know you can assume V(initial) = 0. I get it now but it’s the “common sense” part that confuses me.
I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve.
For the most part the practice was very useful and clear.
I found the sign changes as in the dinosaur problem confusing today. Also I found the work for this problem difficult. I learned the calculus way. Learning through the equations was difficult for me.
There wasn’t anything that was confusing, but I have difficulty knowing which kinematic equation to use for a specific situation.
How to use right hand rule to find vector direction
I didn’t find anything confusing. This is my third time learning this material and it was very similar to the way I was initially taught. The videos are great!
The displacement vector equation confused me because it seemed graphically similar to the resultant vector but, the equation was written differently. Are they the same?
I am still having trouble with the position velocity and acceleration graphs
Some of the velocity and acceleration graphs because I sometimes have to take a second and think before I can see it.
average velocity, average acceleration, and memorization of formulas.","Many students were confused by aspects of the Dinosaur Problem. It might be good to review it again. From a content perspective, some students are concerned about quadratic and kinematic equations, and when to use which one. There are also some issues understanding aspects of circular motion and acceleration, as well average versus instantaneous velocity. Lastly, some students are getting a little lost in the calculus calculations. Taking some time to review these concepts would be helpful.","I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed.

The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand. If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn’t that cancel out one of the tensions ?
the two tensions instead of one
In today’s lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal?
How you could put more than one object in a system
The free body diagram for the man pulling himself up
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple.
I’m confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope.
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish.
Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It’s just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses.
I was confused about the free body diagrams.
The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn’t discussed as much as I would’ve liked.
The part that was confusing about today’s lecture was the problem with the three blocks. I didn’t know how to start the problem or how to draw the free body diagram for that.
Some of the free body diagrams, such as the one with the ice blocks, still are not clear to me
pulleys
I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times. This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
doubling the force of tension
I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from.
I’m a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable
Double tension on a pulley and the principles behind it occurring
The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn’t quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained.
The top hat question about the man pulling himself up with the pulley was the most confusing
How tension was multiplied by 2 in the pulley problem
Multiple tension forces was confusing because of how you set up the FBDs. In addition, the forces on multiple boxes was confusing.
How the tension multiplies across the pulley to make it easy to pull up.
Having blocks run into each other and determining acceleration and forces from this
I struggle with understanding where exactly the tension comes into play in free body diagrams.
Figuring out how the tension was 2 during the problem with the man in the chair

No it was very well explained the free body diagrams
The concept of the pulley with the man on it having two tension forces up
The idea regarding solving to find two equations and plugging one into the other
Nothing was really all that confusing. I had a little trouble understanding the tension forces in the pulley question. I think explaining Tension is pretty important.
The part about doubling the tension force is pretty confusing, because I don’t understand why the force puking the crate up is double the tension force.
I thought the question with tension was challenging and the second part when we had to solve for the guy accelerating at 1.5 was very confusing the way you solved it. I will have to go back and review my FBD!
I had some trouble understanding how two tensions forces existed just by the person holding onto the rope twice, but I think I get it now kinda.
The last example with the three masses pushing on each other on frictionless ice.
I think it would have been more effective if you had explained the FBD for the first example better and how you reached the equation that you got.

I want more examples that have the angle given from another direction than we normally do
I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped.
The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn’t have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today’s lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could’ve been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly.
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside.
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn’t understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
I thought applying Newton’s laws were a bit confusing
I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it
The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me.
I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question
Tension was very confusing in today’s lecture
Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I’m overthinking what the weird relative really means.
The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don’t always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
The question that contains two forces.
In today’s lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton’s first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem. I was not sure about how it worked. Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I’ll just get confuse
I didn’t understand the Newton’s 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton’s laws
I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
normal forces
I didn’t really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good.
N3LP’s could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual.
Nothing
I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton’s second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other.
I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
I could’ve used more questions like the one we did in groups
mass vs weight
I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don’t add.
interial reference frames

I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton’s third law.
I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values.
The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn’t understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons’s first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
Inertial and noninertial because it’s a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
There could have been more explanation connecting Newton’s Laws to the equations.
Today’s lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton’s Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”.
Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions
I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
I always struggled with Newton’s second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton’s second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
inertial with the car - would like more explains of this.
I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.
projectile motion is still confusing

I found the example problem about earth’s gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application.
How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need.
Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution

I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way.
the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful

I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed.
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
gravity based problems
problems including two objects colliding, using both objects’ acceleration
I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations.
I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful
I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it’s graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting.
How accelerations can combine in relative motion.
The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero.
The one thing that I found interesting about today’s lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief.
You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem
The problems were engaging
The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating
Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest.

I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn’t find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction.
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending.
I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today’s lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
The thing that was confusing about today’s lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing
I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn’t understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them.
I wasn’t confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence.
The last question we ran out of time
I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics.
The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle.
How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused.
I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it’s not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
I did not find today’s lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where.
I get confused when to use equations. Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
The last problem was the most confusing for me.
the friction over more than one block on another
I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don’t get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
Friction of one object on top of another
Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer
The thing that I found confusing in today’s lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block
The last problem that dealt with the force needed to move mass 2 on top of mass 1 was tricky
This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It’s hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
I thought that the last question was confusing
The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on.
i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn’t understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem.
The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
Pushing down increasing normal force
Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads.
What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction.
I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately.","Most students had issues with the last problem, the one involving two blocks. There seemed to be some concern about timing, but also setting up the free body diagrams, as well as what forces of friction were working on the system. Principles of friction seemed to confuse many students, but perhaps they will get more practice in homeworks or in-class activities. There were a few students that also called out problems that they had  with ""push vs. pull"" systems.","I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from thepulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set thetensions equal to each other but not conceptually   I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today’slecture.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,5,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"The thing I found most interesting is how and when to use histograms.
I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.)
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion.
I enjoyed learning excel. It’s a great tool and has a high learning curve which I’m excited to get better at it.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for.
Learning how to work better with histograms
It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender)
Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I’m falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me.
When to use the different types of graphs
i liked working with my group
I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.
The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone’s different graph types.
The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that.
I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn’t know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting
What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset.
I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot.
I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph.
I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
Creating the histograms
I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables
I think using excel is interesting.
I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.
it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting.
histograms
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics.
The break out rooms were interesting.
I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
When the quiz will be.
The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments.
I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting
I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information
I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
Ways to use histograms to show data.
I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting because you can use multiple graph types for data.
I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us
It was interesting to learn about histograms.
What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes, because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
I may say the quiz and how to take it.","The class really seemed to find the histograms interesting. They also liked working in breakout rooms and in their groups. The students also seemed to enjoy the time to work on assignments, and found the in-class quizzes helpful.","I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data. Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.   I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other! i liked working with my group I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7.","['I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.', 'I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful.', 'Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.', 'I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,9,,"Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn’t have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought
The class wasn’t confusing today. The class was straightforward and the examples that were provided about the problems and questions asked in the class were especially helpful.
I still don’t really know what the laminar approach is, but I’ll figure it out I guess.
the laminar approach
I didn’t find anything confusing.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10. Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class
There was nothing confusing in today’s class.
Nothing confused me in today’s class
Nothing was really confusing for me today.
Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
I thought today’s lecture was very clear, I would have maybe went over expectations for A11 such as if the linear regression is calculated with a set y intercept at 0 and how that regression works.
What is required for assignment A10
I was confused on A11 problem 1 part 2 it asks for the coefficient of friction of each material but I was lost because it doesn’t say whether to make a chart and solve for each normal force or use regression on the chart we made in problem 1 part 1 to solve for the coefficient of friction of each material.
The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
I’m confused on how to do one of the sections in A10 even after I asked but everything else in class made sense.
nothing
I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
Using a Mac there a lot of tools that are different. It would be helpful if we went over using excel this a Mac or for the video modules to also go over how to use excel with a Mac.
This class really didn’t have anything confusing. I used to be confused on the linear regression model for the Taum Sauk Project but now I understand.
In today’s class, everything made a lot of sense and nothing appeared to be confusing at all!
I found that the volume-height regression equation for assignment 10 was confusing to do as it was hard for me to grasp how to fully realize the equation in a volume vs height form.
I felt that the explanation for the regression data could have been a little longer and more in depth to help alleviate some of the confusion that I had in today’ class.
How we are expected to use the laminar approach for A10 and what values we should be using is confusing at times. The equation is challenging and I don’t know for sure how to get to that point.
I was a little confused on how we ended class. I didn’t quite understand how the slopes and y-intercepts can be different.
I don’t know exactly which models should be calculated because the directions say to calculate the volume of an ellipse
How to use the laminar approach using multiple shapes was confusing because you can’t just change the width and length using the slope formula, some sides are connected
Finding the trendline on a windows computer is hard to figure out.
Still confused on the laminar approach.
The volume of the reservoir has extremely confusing instructions. It says we need volume as a function of height, however we don’t have the height data for the reservoir. How am I supposed to calculate area and height without height?
We were a little confused on A10 and we were hoping for a little more instruction on the modeling process for the visual and Mathematica model.
I was confused I’m general about the laminar approach how you use it.
I think a little bit more explanation on the other factors that are similar to r^2 value would be nice to understand the different ways to use that information.
The assignment that is concurrent with this material in class is not informative on what it wants, so most of the work that is being done is a grey area to my group.
The Part 5 for A10 is confusing
In class I was a little confused on the Part 5 of assignment 10 with the regression lines. My team and I were able to talk to Jeff and figure out what we needed to do!
what exactly is SST? there was more information in the pre class work, but I would understand it better if it was explained in more detail in lecture.
Nothing comes to mind
The laminar approach needs more details! My team is very confused about the assignment 10. We have worked very hard on it and it doesn’t make sense.
What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. My trend line is a constant
This lecture was set up well. Although I believe that the line of regression could have been discussed a little more. Also maybe we could going over the quiz answers is it’s just a one module thing. This class gave me a lot of time to talk.
I didn’t have any problems. My group had some questions in the breakout room, but someone came to help us and had answers.
Laminar approach is slightly confusing.
The way to find a formulae that’s related volume and height was left completely unexplained, I’m still as stuck as ever.
We were confused about the regression model for A10 as a group, but Jeff helped clear things up and now we have a good idea of what to do.
I don’t think anything needs more details. I wish we went over assignments more in class because it would make the whole process of it more clear but I understand it prepares you for the real world.
The laminar approach was confusing and found have been covered in more depth
The difference between r squared and r
What it is we are supposed to do from A10. I am confused about the mathematical models.
I was confused on if we need to know how to calculate R^2 values and sst and sse values
nothing was confusing i enjoyed this class very much
The most confusing part was constructing the mathematical models and how to go about choosing the surface area to start with.
The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
Assignment A11
I have no clue how to do this assignment 10. Calculating the volume with the laminar approach is difficult.
I understood everything today.
The r and r^2 values were confusing to me, I’m not really sure what they are used for
I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.
The difference between SSE and SST.
The assignment itself was a little confusing. I would like some more explanation on that.
I was confused about some parts of A10.
when assignment a11 is due and what our in class quiz is on
SST and SSE
I enjoyed this class. The actual definition of what the r squared value is could have been more clear.","Students have a lot of questions regarding Assignments 10 and 11. This mainly has to do with data analysis and regression, and when to use specific analytical variables (e.g. SSE, SST, r, and r^2). There is also some confusion about the laminar approach, and it might be useful to review this again.","I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation.

I like our project
I really liked this aspect of the project where we model and test our different ideas
The most interest part of today’s class was learning about the different ways to prototype our solutions.
I thought the prototyping methods were interesting. I am excited to try them for my self.
I found it interesting how there are so many softwares available to make pro types on!
This is a long project, so I like how we’re looking back on what we’ve done so far. This may give us a better understanding of how we’ll move forward.
The time to work with our teams in break out rooms
I found it interesting that purdue gives access to lots of tools to help with prototyping.
I liked how much time we got to work on our new assignment.
I thought that coming up with ways to make our prototypes without having cards to many materials was actually really fun to do
Thinking of what ideas we would turn into prototypes
I found the generating ideas for prototypes to be most interesting as I could be creative and think of many possible solutions.
Breakout room
The most interesting think in class to day was Jeff’s very cool costume for Halloween.
Talking about prototyping was interesting and how they can help.
how to access the cad software
I found interesting how we have a 3D printing club where we could use their resources for our project. Also the amounts of available software programs offered by Purdue.
I found it interesting just how many different ways creating a diagram is and how helpful it can be.
I love CAD. I am very happy to be using CAD in this class.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,1,,"I found the class to be interesting and interactive. I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class.
The class activity was interesting.
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn’t expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking.
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive.
The people I met in my group
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today’s class.
I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class.
The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class.
How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it’s really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
i liked learning about the breakout sessions
The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn’t know that was a feature on zoom.
I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too.
Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me.
Learning about future projects
I found icebreaking and drawing very fun.
I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering!
The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
I found the draw an engineer activity interesting
I found the CATME system was very interesting in that it helps students get placed into groups that best fit their schedule.
The drawing activity with predicting a future engineer. 10 years isn’t too distant, but humans tend to be very bad predictors of what the future will hold.
I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I’ve never met someone from Turkey.
What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030.
I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed.
I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.
The most interesting thing in today’s class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.
I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.
I found it interesting talking to the people in my breakout room and seeing what type of things that they think about when it comes to the future of engineering.
I liked being able to work in the breakout room.
The projects looked interesting","Students seemed very happy to have time in breakout rooms and getting to know one another.

I found the information about modeling, the different kinds of modeling, and laminar modeling interesting.
How simple shapes can relate to surface area for a random place. Also that Google earth is a useful tool.
Working in small groups for most of class is nice because it is easier to participate.
The concept of using data over time in excel to calculate the volume of a whole reservoir is an interesting process that I will be interested to explore in the assignment.
I found the idea of the Taum Sauk project to be interesting as it isn’t just creating things, rather identifying how the system works and why it was built.
I found drawing the diagram and calculating the differences in height for each reservoir to be most interesting.
I found interesting how there’s so much behind a hydroelectric dam. So much math which is quite interesting on my end.
The time to work on A10 was helpful
I liked the amount of time we spent in breakout rooms working on our assignment, and after knowing what to do, it was very interesting.
The most interesting thing was deciding what simple shapes to use to model the Reservoir.
The taum sauk reservoir project and the mathematicsl models are a new way of looking at things for me
That making a mode is important
Breakout room is always interesting
I found the most interesting part of today’s class was developing a model. It was cool to see exactly how to do that and then make a mathematical model out of a visual one.
I found the different ways to solve for perimeter on the example in the slides to be interesting. I liked hearing how other people felt about approaching the problem
Working with our teams was interesting because we divided up work and collaborated with eachother.
I enjoyed learning about mathematical models, as well as the part where we came up with our own equations to find the perimeters of shapes.
Being able to work on assignment 10 at the end of class was very helpful. I’m glad we were able to get some things done during class time.
I found that spending more time with our break out groups was helpful for working through any confusion
It was fun and interesting using google earth to map the surface area of the reservoir.
The relationships between shape perimeters and the amount of shapes connected was an interesting demonstration.
I found the idea of being able to make mathematical models just by looking at drawings interesting.
That different models can make the project seem simpler to understand, and that there is a well understood model for the taum sauk reservoir
Talking with my team
How the reservoirs are so different in heights and pump water between themselves.
I really enjoy working with my team since it allows for more time to do the assignments
Today’s class was interesting because we got to start learning about mathematical models.
I enjoyed the algorithms for the shapes. There were so many different answers and I came up with one that was different than everyone else
The Taum Sauk reservoir is interesting
I found the examples for creating mathematical diagrams for the perimeters of the shapes really interesting.
I thought that the mathematical modeling with perimeters Of shapes was interesting and fun
Finding the volume for the reservoir was interesting because we are applying our math knowledge to a real life situation
I found the use of a simplified physical model to be the most interesting part of the day and trying to figure out which model best fit the shape of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
The most interesting part today was working with excel and doing actual calculations.
i was interested by the different types of models we can use
I liked the diagram part.
I found the in class activity to be the most interesting thing in class today.
I enjoyed the part where we were looking at the hydropower plant and doing the calculations
I found it interesting how long we worked in our breakout rooms today.
starting the assignment 10 with out teams
I found that the in class activity was interesting when calculating the pressure height of the reservoir.
I found the depth and the diagram of the reservoir interesting
The shapes exercise
The different ways to find perimeter of irregular shapes
working with my group was nice
nothing that interesting.
That reservoir is cool. I would like to learn more about it snd how it creates energy
I enjoyed working on the team project and getting a chance to work ahead with my group.",Students enjoyed the Tom Sauk reservoir activity and how it allowed them to practically use mathematical modeling.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,10,,"Nothing was confusing
I was confused on how to convert units
We have talked about the quiz and test, everything is clear.
I did not know exactly how to calculate the pressure head because I the slide went by too quickly
Preparing for the exam
Nothing was confusing about today’s class or needed more explanation
I really enjoyed today’s class!!
I was confused by what the student answer sheet meant when it said that the memo gave us data of the volume of the reservoir as a function of time, and I saw no function
There was no in class activity so that was confusing because no one mentioned it. The exam instructions were also a bit confusing.
the flow rate chart was confusing
The instructions for what was going to be on the exam were a little bit confusing, I wish there would have been more detail.
Nothing was confusing today
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class.
I was confused as to why we had so much time in studio time with very little explanation as to what the time was meant for. Also, I did not see how the slides connected with the project. When the teacher explained the pressure head, I was a little confused by what factors go into this. Is it just a height ?
I was a little confused on the process for getting the total power for the Upper Reservoir.
I think the class was well explained today.
How to take exam
This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more as well as more specifics on the exam next week.
How to completely calculate the power
nothing.
The quiz modules did not show up at 3.
It would have been nice to see the class slides on brightspace during lecture.
Basically everything made sense today, i never really had any questions but the ones i did were answered when we went into breakout rooms. It would have been nice if we could have done some review on the quiz
The most confusing part of today’s class was figuring out if we had to do an I class activity. The activity was never mentioned in the meeting so I was confused if I needed to submit anything.
Nothing seemed to be confusing at all in today’s class!
Nothing was confusing. We just sat in breakout rooms working on the projects.
I didn’t find anything confusing in class today.
I thought how we calculate volumetric flow rate was a little bit confusing.
How the excel will work for the in class quiz
Everything seemed straight forward to me. If something seems unclear I will look at the slides or ask questions.
We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
I didn't have any confusion in class today.
After showing the slide on assignment 10, I know I did the models wrong but it wasn’t explained how to do it correctly.
I was confused as to whether there was an in-class participation assignment
There was nothing that confused me during class except for a small part of assignment 12 that my group worked on.
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing was very confusing because we didn’t do much except go to our breakout rooms.
It all made sense today!
If we had an in-class activity
Learning about the second half of the Taum Sauk project was a little confusing
when assignment A12 is due
Nothing was really confusing
The use of excel for A12 needed for explanation","There was some confusion over the calculations that were needed in class, specifically the power calculation. There are some students who had questions about the exam and how to prepare for it. There were also students who were concerned about the quizzes, specifically on how they will work.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,11,,"nothing.
I learned about different things from today’s class about different incidents which I never thought before
I found it interesting how many engineering fails there have been yet we continue to learn from them and improve.
The examples of engineering failures
I found that discussing the errors in different situations very interesting. This is because I heard about one I knew and other I didn’t know about.
mathematical modeling is still really interesting problem solving. wish we had more time.
I found the explanation and discussion of past and possible engineering failures and how to prevent them was the most interesting part of today’s class.
I found the conversation on preventable mistakes very important because these mistakes affect people’s lives or, in extreme cases, take them.
I liked getting to work in breakout rooms, i feel like we have a good amount of work done for the a12 project
It was interesting to research how the Taum Sauk reservoir broke and how much was wrong with it.
I liked having free time to research the taum Sauk upper reservoir failure and how to address engineering failures

Alex,ENGR131_S014,8,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed working with my team in studio time today to work on assignment 10.
I really like statistics and I enjoyed using my calculator to input data and create formulas to represent data. I also did some research on the Taum Sauk reservoir which was fun.
What I found interesting about today’s class was how there are so many different models to depict a system.
I found it interesting that Reservoirs can be so complex. And that so many different types of engineers are needed in order to create such a reservoir.
I thought the laminar approach to modeling was interesting as I had never heard of it before and it made a lot of sense to me.
I found the different ways that values can be approximated to be a cool challenge.
Modeling
Going over simple examples of how to use the laminar approach
I was making charts about the different relationships between volumes of the upper lower and total reservoirs and found their relationships interesting
It was interesting to see the way mathematical models can be used to represent many things.
I found it interesting how we would need to use the vertical cross section in order to determine the change in the horizontal cross section.
I found it interesting how we could fins the distance between the resvoirs
The ability to model anything mathematically
I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft.
I found it very interesting that you are able to find an equation for perimeter that applies for both shapes without having to adjust for each.
Once I can fully understand the concept of outlet models I will find it more interesting
The in-class activity was really important I thought because it was a good “stepping stone” into project 2 and assignment a10.
I found the part of the lecture where you explained Part 4 to be interesting because I started to understand it better
Though everything was already covered by the modules that were required to be completed prior to class, I found it intriguing how the different models show different information and in different ways.
I found the part where we were applying the power equation and information to the Taum Sauk project with our group interesting
I enjoyed learning about modeling. It’s fun to try and predict and create equations for different circumstances.
I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting. Creating these mathematical models will be fun for me.
Its reallly hard to approximate taum sauks volume
The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.
I really liked learning how we solve for P and how to represent something mathematically.
The class in all was very interesting
Excel can be used to create this relationship between volume and water height in the reservoir. I also didn’t realize at first that you have to adjust your volume formula based on the slope when u go deeper. I was assuming that it was just a straight vertical line to the bottom.
It was interesting that I can get estimate value of a stuff in real life with mathematical way.
This class didn’t interest me too much. Just learning nee stuff seemed cool and was good to get in.
I found nothing interesting in class. Being Friday, I was very exhausted and uninterested. However, I will study the topics from class later tonight to get a better understanding of the material.
I thought that coming up with a model for the reservoir was interesting and provided an enjoyable challenge, because it requires some creative thinking.
I found interesting the layering methods we are using because level curves seems to be more accurate.
When we learned about the laminar approach, that was the most interesting to me.
I thought it was great when we were working with our team members. It really helped me understand better.
The most interesting part of today’s class was investigating for the assignment 10 project and learn more about hydroelectric power.
I found the Pressure head calculation applications interesting
getting the volume for the reservoir
I found the additional research on the project my team did today very interesting.
I found it interesting that engineers use units like feet-acres which seem very unusual at a first glance, but actually have a really useful meaning in the real world.
The laminar approach for estimating volume
I found the laminar approach to be the most confusing and the most interesting part of the lecture today. It’s like a three dimensional application of Riemann sums.
How use it is to develop an equation to solve for/simply complex data or problems
I found the formula for the power of the reservoir interesting.
The most interesting thing in today’s class was learning about the drop in altitude between the two reservoirs because I thought it was interesting that the gap was so large.
I really enjoy the progression to more group time
leaning how to model the perimeter of geometric shapes.
I found calculating the pressure head interesting because I had trouble doing that in high school and now it is a little more familiar, so it was fun to practice that again.
The information about modeling.
It was very interesting to start brainstorming ideas and shapes for our models.
I enjoyed the in class activity, it was different to what we have been doing in the last few classes
I really like this project idea. I've modeled a coal-fired generator as a rankine cycle before in my thermodynamics class, and this project seems to be really similar.
The size of the reservoir and how it was best used.
It was very interesting how to calculate the power of the reservoirs
I found the modeling of the reservoir volume interesting since it required me to use some of my skills learned from calculus and other math classes to solve.
Today’s class was great and I ended up getting a lot of work done with my team! I enjoyed the in class activity and learned a lot about the Taum Sauk reservoir. The presentation was very clear and the TAs were helpful.
how useful laminar models can be
we were able to work together again in breakout rooms and so that was good interaction
I really like this project, i find the concept of us working on a real world problem excites me because it helps give incite into what our future is going to look like
The group time was plenty of time for my group to be efficient and work on assignment 10
creating models for a situation
What was most interesting was learning about the laminar model and how it differs from others.
building a mathematical model to solve questions.
The thing I found most important in today’s class is that the mathematical model doesn’t have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.","Overall, it seems that the Tom Sauk Reservoir example really resonated with the students. The class seemed to be focused on introducing mathematical modeling, and using calculations to estimate certain real-world concepts. Students also seemed to appreciate the time that was relegated to working in the group, and on Assignment 10.",I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,4,,"I wasn’t really confused about anything
It seems like the main goal of the bike share project, and especially the smaller assignments due next week, were all brushed over with minimal instruction.
I wish we went over the out-of-class stuff regarding the career selection in just a little clearer detail. It was just a lot all at once, so it got a bit confusing.
The amount of information given in the short amount of time for the next “section” (career exploration) was a little overwhelming and caused a little confusion in what should be done by when.
I thought that learning about the types of the charts was a bit confusing. The examples were pretty easy but then looking at the homework it seems more difficult.
Nothing confusing
Nothing was confusing, I fully understood the graphs in the slideshow as well as the excel graphing methods
The class was well explained it helpful as it gave helpful insight on what and when to look for in terms of Homework and Quizzes.
I thought today’s class was pretty straightforward and nothing was too confusing
Everything seem straight forward today.
Why we use line plots over scatter plots
The slides on the career exploration was a little confusing.
Thought class was good, I was a bit confused when we were going over the sign up sessions.
the different engineering videos we have to watch and when
It would be cool to use the raise hand tool to ask questions while in the slides, and that the participants tab is constantly being looked
Today’s class felt pretty straightforward. Since the in-class assignment was relatively easy to finish you could have possibly made the breakout rooms for that part shorter.
Exactly where assignments need to be submitted was a little confusing, as well as the naming scheme for certain assignments.
It was a little hard to follow what you wanted ya to do for the engineering fields assignments only because there was a lot of information. But I’m sure that as we go though it ourselves we will understand
Nothing! Everything was pretty clear!
I am still slightly confused on the career exploration assignment and if we are required to submit anything or simply attend the four events.
Nothing actually I felt as though this lecture was very slow in explaining graphs. It’s a very basic function of excel and I feel like I lost interest pretty quickly.
I thought that today’s class went well, the breakout rooms were given plenty of time, and initially the EYM sessions vs major videos was confusing, but this was eventually answered! Thanks!
Finding assignments and wear to turn them in is confusing at times. For instance when you look up assignment A03 under the assignment tab, the template and rubric do not show up.
The only thing that maybe could use more clarification is how and where we will be signing up for the engineering discipline classes. Just a quick review of how to sign up would be helpful
The assignment due dates are very confusing. A consolidated calendar that shows all of the due dates would be super helpful; since the calendar in brightspace is hard to naviagte.
This went well. I believe that the break out rooms could be a little longer. My group has been cut off multiple time in the middle of a conversation.
I just thought it was very confusing when we started to talk about assignment 6. I feel like it was a little rusher and I am still confused on what we’re are doing for this assignment.
Nothing was confusing
It’s a little confusing navigating Brightspace to find everything.
I didn’t find anything confusing in today’s class.
There was not much confusion and the class was pretty straight forward.
This class was very clear! It helped that we had the assignments explains and then directly after had time to work on them in our groups.
I thought today’s class was very clear. I may have a biased opinion because I am very fluent in graphing in excel.
Go over the assignments more and not so much the modules that we have already done
The location for turning in items (such as the in class edit of the problem statement) was a little confusing.
Figuring out how to minimize points on a graph.
It is getting better but assignments and deadlines are still a bit confusing.
Are there any major individual assignments coming up? How do we do the bike share assignment?
I found nothing to be of great confusion to me during todays class.
Not really anything
Nothing was confusing for me today
I didn’t find anything confusing.","A majority of the students are still a little confused about how to submit assignments and what needs to be submitted for assignments. This ties into some Brightspace issues other students are having. Some students are still having some issues about making graphs and using graphs, so maybe a quick refresher for next class.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,6,,"I liked that we had a lot of time to work on assignment 8.
It was interesting working on our project in the breakout rooma, i enjoyed getting a head start on it with my group
I like the breakout room so that I can discuss few things with my group members
Z scores are interesting
I have always loved statistics and probability, so the subject is right up my alley.
I found the z score stuff to be quite interesting. I think that it is cool that there is a score that tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean.
I enjoyed learning about z-scores and probability, and I liked exploring Excel a little more in A08 when we had time to work on it.
I enjoyed meeting with my team and z scores were cool to imagine histograms
I thought the skittles activity was interesting
I was interested by the z-score table. It is a cool way to find the probability without having to use a calculator. Also it is a useful way to correlate histograms to the probability of an event.
I found the skittle activity to be interesting in today’s class. It was a fun way to invite ya into the world of histograms and z chart.
I liked working with my group on A08 for a longer period of time.
A purdue alumni works for Wrigley and uses this class to collect data.
learning around z scores
I like social interaction, which is what the breakout rooms are.
learning about z-score was interesting
Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today’s class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems.
I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
I found that the equation for the normal curve to be most interesting simply because of its complexity and universality.
I liked how we were able to work in groups on our projects with in class time because it helps when I have questions
I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
The use of a physical example for data.
I love having studio time with my and being able to bounce ideas off of them for the assignments.
20 pm
The most interesting thing about class today was being able to finish our discussions because we got a good amount of time in our break out rooms. I also believe that the histograms and probability was explained very well.
Learning about probablilty and statistics was cool.
The skittles data was interesting when learning about Z-score.
I found the probability conversation and the histogram conversation the most interesting today in class.
I liked how all of our data was consolidated as one sheet. I didn’t know that that was possible before class.
Learning about histograms
Nothing, was mostly group work.
I found the skittle data to be the most interesting. I knew about z scores before but it was interesting to see how that can fit into engineering.
I liked working on the group on assignment a05. the assignment seems easy but will need time to work on it.
Today I learned that u can copy and paste the same formula into different columns by dragging the lower right hand corner.
I found the explanation of z score and other statistics practices interesting today
I found it interesting how before class was pushed online, each team would get there own bag of skittles.
Nothing was very interesting it was pretty boring honestly we just sat in our groups doing our own work and not talking which wasn’t exciting.
The actual project itself was interesting. The skittles was an interesting and creative idea but I would have loved to do it in person.
The z tables because I’ve never heard of that
Creating histograms from the data given to me. I like organizing the excel sheet and finding the mean and standard deviation of it.
I liked the introduction of interpreting z-score and histogram data using calculus. With having taken a few calc courses already, this was an interesting insight.
Z scores were interesting review. I didnt remember how to apply that on a histogram
I found compiling the data for skittles to be fun and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed it
I’m beginning to understand how to work with excel. I had no previous experience with excel and throughout the last few weeks I have started to be able to work with it.
The way we used skittles to represent probability. It makes class more interesting and engaging using relatable topics.
I liked that we had time to start on assignment A08 today in class. I also greatly appreciated the clarification on the quiz and assignment due dates.
It was interesting working with skittles and normal curves today. I took AP statistics last year in high school so I enjoy this subject.
I like manipulating data on excel so I was happy to be able to work with my team and manipulate some data.
I found most interesting in today’s class what Z-Score I never knew about it until this class
What I found most interesting in today’s class was getting to know my group members better.
I found it interesting that histograms can be so informational. I haven't had much experience beforehand with them.
Z Scores, although I have covered them in high school statistics class.
Using histograms to find probabilities
I found it interesting how any histogram can be turned into a normal deviation and then used to calculate percentages from there
I found learning about standard deviation to be most interesting.
Seeing in more details the uses for histograms.
I liked getting to work on our upcoming assignments in breakout rooms. It’s nice to have a team that can easily help with everything.
I found the informations about normal curves to be most interesting
I found it interesting how you can standardize data in order to get more accurate probabilities
learning how we would be calculating with class data
I found the skittles project interesting overall. I think it’s a fun little assignment to get a handle on histograms and overflow bins.
I found the skittle example interesting
I liked learning more about z score and statistics
The z score tables
I find the histograms really interesting because of how well they can show data numbers for a given set
The skittles and z-score
I enjoyed learning an intro to statistics and z scores and normal curve. Interesting stuff
Skittles project.
Counting skittles
Learning how z scores and normal distribution works was interesting.
I found the refresher on z-scores and normal distribution interesting
The most interesting thing was working with my team and helping each other through assignment A08
Applying what we were learning to the skittles example.
Something important in today’s class was the z scores we learned about.
Learning about the histograms and the z score was interesting to me",Students were heavily interested in learning about z-scores and probability. Some students really enjoyed using the Skittles activity as a way to learn or review this content. Histograms were also an interesting topic.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
Excel is still confusing to use.
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered.
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear!
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense!
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins.
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one.
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended?
Nothing really was confusing to me today.
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart.
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me!
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph.
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
Balancing number of bins and bin width
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity.
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
nothing
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel.
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes.
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.
Nothing
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
I felt comfortable today.
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it.
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over.
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at.
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins.
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","It seems that a majority of the issues that students had with this class had to do with Excel. It seems that they mainly had difficulty with the overflow and/or the underflow bins. Additionally, there were several issues involving the creation of the histograms. There also seems to be confusion regarding assignments and also due dates.

Exam
I really liked the amount of time we had in breakout rooms to work on A12.
Talking and communicating with my teammates
nothing.
Nothing stood out as it was mostly group work.
Using math in class is getting interesting, more than just finding means, now we are using slope and instantaneous rate
I liked getting to work in the breakout rooms, I feel like my team has a good understanding on the a12 assignment
The most interest part of today’s class was learning about the volumetric flow rate and how to calculate it of multiple intervals.
I found it interesting how we are taking the slope and are going to change its units to get different values of Q.
I liked how we talked about voting, bought awareness to it and I now know I can use my Purdue ID card.
I liked that we got so much time to work with our team in class. It helped to get all of us on the same page.
I thought that the fact that a12 was a continuation of a10 was interesting.
Getting a good start on A12
I was sent to the wrong break room and met new people so that was interesting.
There was not a whole lot of new information in this class besides information about assessments and assignments
I found the instant volumetric flowrate calculations to be most interesting as I like calculus.
I found working with my team most interesting.

There was nothing confusing or difficult in today’s class. Everything was discussed well and straight to the point
we could of gone more in depth on what can be learned from others past failures.
I did not feel that anything discussed in today’s class was confusing or needed more details.
I think I would like more information on the exam but it may be that I am nervous about it.
this class wasnt very confusing, however it would have been nice if we could have done more review for the exam
It was confusing that we had to know what engineering fields were needed to solve this problem when we have no finished the career exploration activity.

Nothing was confusing in this class.
I felt like the class was straightforward and there wasn’t much confusing today. The In Class Activity directions were slightly confusing to me but other than that it was a non confusing class.
I thought we would review more for the exam, but we barely went over any information.
I was a little confused on the first assignment that we did in class. I was having a hard time finding very specific information on the failure of the dam.
I thought that a little more instruction for the in class activity would have been helpful, like if we had to give references or not (I just assumed that we did). But in the end this wasn’t a big worry.
I was confused by the instructions meant by what disciplines of engineering would have helped improve the disaster in the future. I did not know what the profesor was referring to. Secondly, I was confused by how the test will be proctored on Friday but this was eventually cleared up
The most confusing part of today’s class was trying to forgive out the unit conversions for the power calculation in assignment A12.
Some of how the exam was going to work was a little confusing.
The class was not involved with very much content today, so it was not much of an issue with it being confusing.
How we will work the equation into our assignment
I found that calculating the flowrate over distinct time intervals was confusing as when I originally calculated it I thought that it was in acreft/min but it was actually in acreft/day which changed the data a lot.
Everything was clear in today's class.
I did not find anything confusing about today’s class. Everything was relatively straightforward.
The details of the exam needed more details, it would be helpful to know more about it.
I do not believe anything was confusing.
The only confusing part of the class for me was making sure we are using the right formula for the power.
There was nothing confusing about today’s class. It was pretty straight forward.
Everything was well explained this lecture, especially the exam and I greatly appreciate the explanation of what the exam will have on it.
I think everything seemed straight forward. I can just look back to the slides if I’m confused.
I didn’t find anything confusing about today’s class or content.
Nothing comes to mind
Nothing was confusing this class.
The concept of engineering discipline training was confusing. I would also say the inclass activity was a little bit confusing
I thought there was going to be more exam review during class today. Going over the practice exam would have been helpful in terms of studying.
I would have talked a slight bit more about the in class assignment, but this was not a confusing class, maybe more about the exam next class too.
Still difficult to use excel in shared function. If you could explain the best way to work in an excel as a group so that you could still have all the chart functions and most updated version that would be great.
The only thing I found a little confusing was details about what are going to be in the exam, but I’m sure that will be explained in the exam folder
What the Exam will look like on Friday
Todays class was pretty straightforward, although more information on the exam would be nice
nothing
The instructions for the in class assignment were kind of vague. I wasn’t for sure what you were expecting out of me.
The part of the in class activity that asked about the discipline of engineering training that would prevent failure was confusing and I wasn’t sure what exactly it was asking for in that part.
the reasons that the tatum sauk upper reservoir failed was somewhat confusing to me
I am confused on why the exam is worth so many points
Nothing was especially confusing we were all doing our project as normal so it went well.
I think the exact way to use excel to find the slopes for volumetric flow rate needed more explanation.
Nothing! It all made sense!
There are not confusing things for me.
I do not understand the models. I still don’t understand the models for assignment 12
Nothing was confusing
The calculations can get confusing for this project
Nothing
Trying to figure out what improvements to make on our assignment 10 for assignment 12
Everything was clear.
What was the purpose of learning about the taum sauk reservoir other than it was related to our project.
Calculating pressure head is still confusing to me.
The most confusing part was how to calculate the sections for instantaneous velocity for A12
where the practice exam is
i wish i had more time for the in class activity.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing, I’m pretty aware of everything going on.
In class today I do not think that anything was confusing.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing was really confusing
Exam 1
The procedures for the exam on Friday were a little confusing","Many students still have some anxieties and questions regarding the exam. It might be helpful to set out a reminder email highlighting the specifics before the exam period.

I liked working on the project with my group, i liked brainstorming ideas for examples in nature
It was interesting to see how far the pros and cons identification could go ( the price of phone customer service, etc)
The time to work in class
The breakout room
I found learning about morphological charts interesting.
I found the evaluation of pros and cons in every day life interesting. I saw that recyclability was a pro and had not realized it before.
I found how useful looking at the pros and cons of different ideas is to getting a working and viable solution to be the most interesting part of today’s class.
I found the conversation of the design process and the different criteria and constraints to be the most interesting!
I found the brainstorming process very fun and challenging.
I found going over the requirements of the project at the end of class helpful, I was confused at first of what sections to do.
I think that the weighing pros and cons is helpful and it is an interesting way to make decisions that we do every day
Finding pros and cons is interesting because each product or service you can think of always has a way to do it better
The pros and cons about different subjects was interesting, and delving into explicit constraints that should always be considered.
I found interesting how we compared the different coffee machines. Also how pros and cons are used in engineering.
I really enjoy making low fidelity prototypes
I found it interesting how we went thought assignment 17 before we left class.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,1,,"I didn’t find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today’s lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely.
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved.
I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group.
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails. I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class.
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn’t anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well.
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction
Overall today’s class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
They was a lot of information thrown, I would’ve liked a calendar with when all the homework’s and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules.
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class.
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students.
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing?
Everything seemed clear to me
Nothing
There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class.
I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It’s not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course.
i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar.
The way assignments on brightspace are organized.
Today’s class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the next lecture.
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class. Today’s class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester.
I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today’s class.
I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3. I’m not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I’ll send an email. Other than that I understand everything.
Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them.
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project?
I’m still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward.
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade.
There wasn’t much that I found confusing or unclear in today’s class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out.
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!!
In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it’s recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting?
Everything was clear. However, I’m somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday
N/A
I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help.
I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear.
There were no confusing things in the lecture.
Today’s class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn’t really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn’t a whole lot to be confused about.
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided.
It was all pretty clear!
I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow.
Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today’s lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear.
Maybe more details in the CATME assignments.
There wasn’t anything confusing that we discussed in today’s class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand.
I found nothing in today's class that was confusing.
Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment.
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read.
It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project.
I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester?
When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that’s due before class 1B?
So far I felt that everything in today’s class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system.
I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted.
I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future.","A majority of the students seem to be confused mainly about the projects and assignments.

I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
The most interesting part of today’s class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment. Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting.
I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class.
I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today’s class.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was.
I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact
I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car’s carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work.
I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later.
I thought that the most interesting thing in today’s class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about.
I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13.
I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.
I liked looking at the carbon footprint website today! It was really interesting!
The carbon footprint calculated that you had us complete in class
footprint calculator website
The time in break rooms was very helpful for getting some team work accomplished.
I found it interesting how many planets I would need
I found it very interesting that we got to find the amount of CO2 that our cars emit, it’s nice to know what impact we have on the environment
A13 and the environment pictures were very cool.
Climate change stuff was interesting, but I have heard it all before.
Calculating the carbon footprint
using the website to see my environmental impact
my carbon footprint
I found the carbon footprint activity interesting!
Working on calculations with total solar panel cost
I thought that the time given to work on A13 was good!
i like talking to my teammates
I thought it was interesting how we could see how many planets it would take if everyone acted like me and lived like me.
I enjoyed the long amounts of time we had to work as a team on the assignment
I found the before and after pictures I retesting because they show how drastic the changes are.
Learning about Car Emissions
I thought the footprint website was interesting
Studio time
I found it interesting that people have such a large impact on the environment.
I found the in class activity about CO2 produced by cars was very interesting
Working on the solar panel project
It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints
How fast we can get certain assignments completed
I found it interesting doing the environmental aspect of the project. It’s definitely one of the things that I am interested in when thinking about becoming an engineer.
Jeff got right to solving the problem before it could become a huge issue.
I found the carbon emission of my car interesting.","Students were very interested in the carbon footprint activity, and also calculating the amount of CO2 emissions that come from thier cars.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,7,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"I think that the class today was executed well and I’m starting to understand the class in a greater depth.
More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today’s class. Information was given really well.
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar.
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today’s class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn’t see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear.
I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.
The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet
Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.
In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.
I did not find anything confusing today.
Lots of different due dates
The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well
I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
Everything was understandable.
How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing
The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
I found nothing confusing.
Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
Nothing was very confusing.
Nothing was very confusing in today’s class. As we’ve now reached the fourth week of class, I’ve adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments
The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don’t think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn’t find anything that describes these models.
It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
the new project
The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment.
There wasn’t anything too confusing in today’s class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","Most of the confusion from the lecture came from details regarding assignments, mainly Assignment 10. Many students asked for more details, feedback, or guidance regarding some of the activities they were asked to do. In addition, some students are still having issues in regards to citations and/or setting up their profiles to conduct scholarly work. There were consistent issues when it came to due dates, which ties back heavily to Assignment 10. It would be good to clarify this. Lastly, some students are still having issues with some of the equations and calculations that they were asked to do.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,3,,"I found the video very interesting because it stressed how important it is for engineers to do many trials on products before releasing them.
I liked meeting up with my teammates and talking about when we should meet up with each other.
I liked going into the breakout groups, my group was alot more talkative and helpful compared to other groups i was in in the past. I liked getting to manuplite the graphs in excel, although it took us awhile to figure out how to do it correctly
What we learned in Excel was really cool when we could figure out what to do.
The talk and examples about having a diverse engineering team was interesting and the video example was a good example of a product which did not have a large and diverse data set during development.
I found learning how to create graphs to be the most interesting part, and I think the most exciting part was meeting my team.
Meeting my other group members and collaborating with them.
The team work actually. Though it is confusing at first but it turns out to be interesting that work with other three people.
I enjoyed working with my team and getting to know each other, since we’ll be working together for the rest of the semester.
Meeting my engineering group was definitely the best part of class!
Meeting my team members and working on the first problem together.
the pivot tables
meeting my group, but it was just me and my partner the rest of my group wasn’t there.
I have been curious to meet my teammates since I learned that I would have them, so it was nice to finally meet them.
The discussion about mean,median, and mode.
Breakout rooms
I found the “racist soap dispenser” very interesting. I don’t understand how a huge company like Facebook could make an engineering mistake like that.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was meeting my group members that I’ll be working with this semester.
The different lessons in excel were very helpful as I had little to no experience with them. They will be useful in my assignments on analyzing data.
I found the different interpretations of the term “average” in real world situations to be interesting.
It was interesting how excel could be used in a variety of ways to make sense out of the bike share data.
The excel skills
pivot tables and my new team
I think the Excel stuff is pretty interesting. I think the filters and pivot tables and pivot charts seem very useful.
The diversity announcement was very intriguing. I liked how it was incorporated and how we touched upon how it relates directly to engineers.
I found the example of how racial bias can be used in engineering projects interesting as was displayed in the video.
learning how to arrange data in different ways in excel
I found the multitude of ways to extrapolate data and outliers from the datasets to be very interesting.
I found it very interesting that all of my group members are on campus. We can all meet in person and don’t have to worry about different time zones.
It was interesting to meet my teammates
Meeting with my team and doing the looking at data
I found our groups interesting and I liked meeting everyone that I will be working with.
I enjoyed meeting my group and learning more about the process of analyzing data in excel.
I really liked how we were able to breakout into our teams for the semester. We were able to get to know them better and establish a schedule so that we could meet whenever we had time.
It was interesting that some technology has not been programmed to recognize different skin tones.
I really liked meeting my group and spending time in breakout rooms! I wish we got more of that in the first half of class as well!
The ability to use different filters to manipulate data
The interesting thing in class today was the video explaining how engineers should take into account the diversity of the end users. If the testing was done by a group of not very diverse team, the user experience of the diverse end users could be greatly affected.
I thought it was interesting seeing to what extent you can manipulate the charts in excell to visualize the data
Learning about excel was interesting.
I enjoyed getting to meet my teammates, and I found the data sets and analysis interesting. It gave a good foundation of how to properly use excel, and it worked well for me in the end.
I thought the part about the effects of not having diversity in an engineering team was very educational.
It was cool to meet my team members
I found it interesting that Excel has so many helpful features.
Meeting my team that i will be working with for the rest of the semester was the most interesting thing for me.
I thought that manipulating the data set was very interesting as well as how much information can be derived from an excellent sheet.
The youtube video was interesting regarding why diversity is useful when creating new products
Learning how to use excel
Meeting with my group.
We got to meet our groups for the semester.
I liked all the info that was available to collect through cogo bike share

N/a
I found the white board feature most interesting about today’s class. I have never used that before. I liked that we could all share ideas creatively.
nothing
Designing solutions was fun.
I think that the idea generation strategies are cool and biomimicry was fascinating.
Learning about the different types of idea generation methods

Alex,ENGR131_S014,13,,"I was not confused about anything
In today’s class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense!
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
nothing
How to calculate some of the stuff on assignment 13
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
The A10 to A12 reflection wasa bit confusing but I talked to my GTA and we solved it
Energy calculations
The aspects of the environmental impact of carbon energy could have been covered more since solar was the main focus of the class.
Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
The most confusing part of today’s class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable. There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
I was a little confused of what was expected about the in class assignment. I don’t know if my work was correct.
We were given a lot of time for the in class assignment. This was much more time than necessary as all of our group members had turned it in before the breakout room was over and we felt like we were missing a part of it because there was so much extra time.
we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear
Today was a straightforward class, this made sense and i feel there wasnt anything really confusing.
Nothing much the solar panel technical brief provided a lot of information and the imperfections of solar panels which is my delegated part
where to get the data for the project
If we could get a demo on how to move those charts from the pdf to an excel file that would be lovely
I was having trouble at first of finding information to include in the problem statement because There was no memo.
I think today’s class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
Everything is pretty clear. And I am glad to hear about the message about midterm!
The most efficient way to do A13
Today’s lecture is very clear for me, and I fully understand the materials
Today’s assignment was not confusing, although if anything there could be slightly more explanation on the procedure for the solar energy project.
I didn’t find anything confusing during this lecture. If anything I would say the rubric was slightly confusing as it was a lot of i formation at once but all in all it was that confusing of a lecture.
The class wasn’t confusing, unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
The in class participation was a little confusing on what you wanted for us to put in the word document. More specific details could have been shared, but it was navigable.
Today was a straightforward class, and since for the most part we did the project, nothing was likely to come up anyway.
I did not find any part of today’s class confusing nor did I need more details.
I was confused with the direction that we were supposed to go with the project for finding information about the public library like there emissions and economic information.
I didn't understand what all the energy units meant.
It would have been a little easier to understand how solar panels worked if we had more pictures
I was confused on the in class activity. Were we supposed to create a conversion tool or find one online?
Do i have to choose between the two scenarios or can we have a happy medium
The only confusing aspect of class today was trying to figure out the criteria and constraints of A13.
The in class activity today was a bit confusing. I wasn’t sure if I was just supposed to find a reputable source for a conversion tool, or if I was supposed to be converting energy units.
It would be helpful if we went over more of what is expected in the new assignments we get. My group was confused where to start for a while.
I was a little confused when we started to talk about the different types of energy and how to convert units.
Nothing! It was all clear!
I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
I was a little confused on some of the energy topics and the criteria in assignment 13. After talking to my team I was no longer confused.
how the entire in class assignment needed to work
I think that everything in class today was very well explained!
The only thing I needed more details on in today’s class was when the exam grades will be released.
I do not believe today’s class was confusing in any way. It was a smooth class.
The places to find information are not easy to find for this project.
There was a lot of break out room time.
I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in.
I'm still a little confused on the difference between criteria and constraints.
I thought that most of what was talked about in class was pretty straightforward.
I think that this class was straightforward and provided us with all the information we needed in order to succeed in the project
Looking at assignment 13, the economic part is confusing
Nothing was confusing
Today’s class was great!! Nothing needed clearing up!
nothing
The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
The class was not confusing because we did not go over a whole lot of information
Everything seemed straight forward in glass today. If I do get confused I will look back at the slides and recording.
Nothing

I didn’t think anything was confusing in class today. I am pretty familiar with excel so it wasn’t much of a challenge for me, and I was able to help out others with figuring out how to get the data from CoGo into excel.
I feel like for how much we used excel in today’s lesson, it really needed to be explained better. Not many people knew how to fix the problem, and for learning how to use it, it would have been better to do it in a big lecture where we could follow a long with the professor and have our questions answered. I think the Problem Scoping could have been explained better too.
Excel practice at the end was confusing because we didn’t have much time
Downloading the file and getting the proper form
I was a little confused on how to properly fill out Assignment 03 as it was not discussed. I was still also confused by the end of class what exactly was due when.
I was a little confused today when we where downloading the file from online and making it available to use on excel. I think we could have slowed down there a little bit to make sure all of the students are on the same page and are able to open up the spreadsheet without any errors.
The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation. However, I ended up figuring it out by altering the scientific notation cells.
I was really confused on what the Problem Statement was supposed to be about. I didn’t really understand what problem needed to be solved, and much less what solution I should come up with to solve it.
I was very stressed during class because Excel was not working and I felt the time in the break out rooms was too short. Also the data represents measurements was very confusing.
I think that the problem statement needed some more explaining. I feel like I had a general idea of what I needed to accomplish however I almost felt lost like I didn’t know exactly what I was doing when constructing my problem statement.
I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven’t used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice.
Excel stuff was confusing and the problem statement
Some of the instructions for the in class activities were a little unclear.
I found it confusing when I tried to download the data sheet to excel. I also was kicked from the zoom call and had trouble getting back in to the call.
Everything was properly explained in this meeting.
The Excel data file for bike share wasn’t able to be opened on my laptop for some reason.
Nope
The largest issue was the download link for Excel, vbut thatbwas resolved quickly.
How to access the excel file. I couldn’t get it to open but then we eventually figured it out so it was good!
Excel was pretty confusing to start, but with the help of the ta’s i was able to calculate the value, but it was 35 instead of 3.5 to whatever value, which was confusing.
I had a bit of trouble loading the Excel file but I got it figured out. I am still confused about the exact requirements of the problem statement.
I felt like I didn’t have enough time to finish the problem statement and my work seemed sloppy to me.
Nothing!
The problem statement outline was not very helpful and the problem we were asked to find seem very vague.
How to export data into Excel. I could not quite figure out an easy way to do it.

I could have used a couple more details on when we’d be placed with our actual group project team members and how long we’d be with those members.

The detailed projects that make up the class
I thought that the data collected in excel was interesting. I found that it was cool that the company was able to track and see how long each individual rider rode the bike.
I didn’t think much was interesting, but I would have liked to hear more about the Problem Statement.
I had never heard of problem statements so that was interesting to learn.
Getting to roughly examine the file and analyze their data
I found the design and scoping cycle/process to be the most interesting because it will be an integral part of this class and in a future career.
I found learning about how to write a problem statement the most important and most interesting today. I also found learning about excel to be interesting.
I found it really interesting how much data was collected from the bikes, and how much information you can track down from one excel file.
I was interested in how much data was collected by bike share. It seemed like they had a lot of information.
Proble scoping
I really liked how we were able to use excel and import data from online into an excel sheet and therefore analyze the data and make statements based on what we saw.
I find the bike share project very interesting.
The bike data
Looking through the CoGo data on Excel and analyzing trends was very interesting.
The data sheet from CoGo Bike Share seemed very interesting especially the data for trip duration.
The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
the categories of data that we discussed in class were very interesting
I found other students opinions on how CoGo Bike Share would find the solution we could come up with on how to solve there problem.
I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
The breakout rooms and the project in general was very interesting. Even learning about the problem statement.
Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups
I liked doing the complex calculations in excel
I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.
I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email.
How to use excel
How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.

N/A
I found it interesting that this is our last project and how much time will be spent on it.
I think the fact that we are coming up with a solution that could improve campus is interesting because of how relevant it is to us as students.
The differences in expert and amateur engineering design products
I found the design process the most interesting!

The new project seems interesting.
I found it interesting how we get to combine all of the skills we learned in the past three projects in this final project!
that we are going to be designing our own idea
I found it interesting how big this project is going to be but I think it was cool that is relates directly to me at Purdue.
I found it interesting how we are spending 6 weeks on our design project.
What i did understand was very interesting and exciting
I liked that we’re actually moving towards an actual problem solving assignment compared to just excel tables before now. I like the design process a lot more than tables and calculation.
I found the design process interesting

Alex,ENGR131_S014,3,,"I didn’t find anything confusing in class. I understood the concepts and my group worked well together to accomplish our tasks. The break out sessions were also a good amount of time.
The in class assignment was very confusing, I had no idea what to submit into bright space. The presentation slides weren’t put on bright space either. The instructions for what we were supposed to do once in our team groups should be more specific.
You went very fast when going through excel, and it wasnt super clear as far as what we were supposed to submit. If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call it would be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them if we get lost during a call
I wish that we got some better instructions on what we were supposed to do for the In-Class Activity. My group had a hard time figuring out what to do.
Pivot tables were sort of rushed through and their uses weren’t fully explained which left my breakout group confused on what to do.
I think what we were supposed to do with the excel document was a little bit confusing. The directions weren’t super specific and I thank the assignment should have been clarified a little better.
A more in depth explanation of PivotTables. My whole group did not know how to answer the in class assignment. The videos before class helped explain this but did not explain it in its entirety.
Maybe more about the team project? And the bike project too.
I was confused about the in-class assignment and what needed to be submitted on the excel document.
The amount of time spent during class explaining the different data types could use some lengthening.
I think everything was quite clear. I just need to get more comfortable with excel.
nothing except how to filter properly
doing excel, specifically the pivot chart was confusing
Very little. I would have likes more time spent in the groups, but I assume that we’ll get more of that further into the project.
I had a hard time saving my excel document with the graph on it. It kept saying I could not save it because it had multiple files.
How to use pivot tables and making graphs from them.
I was confused by how we were supposed to organize the central tendency information in the excel document.
I was lost on the in class excel activity today. I could not figure out how to find the outliers for the birth year.
Everything was explained enough, except for the due date of the bike share project and a mention of CAD.
The class went smoothly except for the amount of time I had to work on excel. I have limited experience with excel so just more review on that would be great.
I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment.
What we are supposed to do with the outliers
the class participation activity
I’m just confused on what each platform we are using is for. We have so many and I just want to know their purpose.
The Excel sheets are still confusing to me. It’s hard to locate and place everything that is needed. The steps can get a little tricky as well.
What information needed to be submitted on excel when looking for the outliers was a little confusing.
how to submit our outliers into bright space( what form was acceptable)
I was confused in today’s class because we were given somewhat vague instructions on how to submit the in class participation assignment because we were just submitting a response (which could have been done in a word document or directly on bright space)but we also needed a visual even if we did not use a graph(which would have required the spreadsheet).
I didn’t find anything very confusing today for class except for the fact that I was kicked from the Zoom call due to internet issues.
In the breakout rooms we rhiught we had to start working on assignment 5 instead of 4. I also didn’t understand very well what we have ti submit in the excel spreadsheet. Like I don’t know if we just have to submit our Pivot Table or just the date or what
Today’s class went very smoothly. I am confused why the professor jumped to Assignment 4 and 5 when most people did not submit looking at data yet.
I think that the amount of assignments we have is a little confusing and I wish there was a list of all of them with dates that I could check off as I complete them.
The class wasn’t confusing today except for maybe a stronger explanation of directions for the overall objective of the assignment or where we are supposed to go for the assignments.
I think that the most confusing part in today’s class was the pivot tables. I have been using excel extensively for over a year but i never used pivot tables so it may take me some time to get used to the pivot tables but as of now they seem somewhat confusing.
The instructions for the descriptive statistics activity weren’t very clear and I wasn’t sure how to present what I found.
Most of the stuff explained today was pretty clear! I wasn’t able to get slack though so it would be nice if we were sent the link on bright space or email as well!
My group and I had a little bit of trouble knowing exactly what you wanted us to do with the information in the excel spreadsheet. We ended up submitting some things we had created but weren’t sure on what you wanted.
The assignment was kind of confusing. I wasn’t very sure what was expected from us on the pivot table. I was able to find the outliers, average, median and mode, but was confused about the pivot table.
I didn’t find anything confusing today
It got a little confusing when we were sent to our breakout groups because I wasn’t very sure what to do.
Some of the excel information was just grazed over, so it made it somewhat difficult to do what I needed to do in the breakout sessions, but it ended up being okay.
I wasn't quite clear on what was meant by reformatting data or what a useful format would be.
I still don’t understand when to use the Slack communication platform. Is it something we should be checking daily or 2-3 times a week?
I do not know what to turn into what module. The modules make it confusing to know what I should be turning in.
I found nothing confusing today.
Thought it was a good class, the objectives were clear and I was able to keep up for the most part.
I think it was a little confusing for some people when doing the excel assignment since some people are still getting used to it and you went a little fast.
How much detail we needed to put into the class activity with the finding birth year outliers
Some of the in class assignments have unclear instructions.
Everything was clear.
I think that some of the info was rushed because of lack of time. I think breakout rooms were too short
I wasn’t very confused in that class. I learned a lot about what the class will be about and what we will learn.","The students seemed to have the hardest time figuring out what the instructions entailed for this class and its assignments.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,7,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed looking at the statistics and working with my group in class 4a.
Researching about the reservoir was interesting.
I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project.
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
The reservoir
I liked working with my group today
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles.
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today.
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have.
How hydropower generators worked
I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of.
I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power.
I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened.
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results.
I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing.
The dam
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.
the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so
This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more.
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it.
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators. I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion.
I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting.
The new project about the dam.
How to properly cite your sources.
The introduction to the new assignment
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
Working on real projects that are also interesting
The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
the hydro powered generators
I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting","The students were very interested in hydroelectric power and the reservoirs. Group work and citations were also of interest to the class. The new project seems to interest the students, as well.","I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting  Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work  Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,4,,"I found it interesting how we’ll be getting a lot of info from engineering schools that we didn’t even declare for.
I didn’t know how to manipulate graphs in excel so that was good to learn about.
I felt like I really learned a lot in class today, especially what makes a good client statement. I would love to hear some more details about it mostly involving aspects like wording.
I found the explanations and visuals explaining when to use different graphs and charts was very interesting.
I think that the professors and PTs did a good job explaining the projects and the due dates.
Excel graphs
The table showing which graph to use
I found the scatter plots interesting. Working with excel is a helpful process that is being pushed onto us in a very consistent and assisting manner.
Making charts was pretty interesting because I didn’t know you could change axis limits
I found interesting/important how the professor explained things on bright space and upcoming due dates. Makes student feel a little more confident on what’s going on. Really appreciate it.
Working with group on assignment
The several different engineering schools that are available to me.
I felt as though getting to decide what branch of engineering we will be attention going to enter was pretty cool.
learning how to make graphs in an efficient manner
I liked the fact that we were given time to work during the class. Usually classes are really fast, and this slows it down and allows better understanding ( for me)
I found learning about the different chart types and the various purposes of each chart to be interesting.
Seeing which types of plots were used for different sets of data was interesting.
In class I most enjoyed going out into break out rooms because I was able to learn from my peers and collaborate on the assignments given to us
I found the career exploration zoom thing really interesting and feel like it will help me chose my field!
Identifying the correct chart to use based on data sets
I did find interesting the different reasons to use different graphs and the graphic you used will be very helpful.
The formatting of the graphs in excel was interesting. I learned a lot about how to use the program.
The career exploration opportunities should be a good way for me to learn about the possible disciplines in engineering
I found it interesting that certain practices in my high school statistics class conflict with how engineers analyze data. Specifically the fact that engineers start their x axis at points other than 0.
Getting to know my engineering team on a better basis was definitely the most interesting part of class. Spending more time in breakout rooms would be helpful.
The most interesting thing in class today was learning about how each chart should be used.
I thought it was interesting how we didn’t spend much time working with our breakout groups.
The opportunity to learn about other engineering careers was interesting
I enjoyed making the line/scatter plot.
I thought it was interesting that we get to hear about so many different colleges of engineering.
Using excel to make charts was very useful and interesting.
The class today was interesting because we are getting better with excel and it helps to have it shower and then to have time to work and do it ourselves!
What I found interesting was that there were different types of graphs that are used for different applications.
Differences in charts
It was nice to learn about the types of charts and their applications, as well as trying out our own.
I found it very interesting to manipulate graphs in excel. It seems like it will be a very handy tool.
I found it interesting how many small details are put into professional graphs and charts.
Excel
The most interesting thing in todays class was learning more about what charts are the most appropriate during certain situations.
I found that figuring out which chart to use was the most interesting
I found it interesting about how different graphs can manipulate and display different data

Alex,ENGR131_S014,15,,"I understood everything
The way to do the calculations of the carbon emissions was confusing and I did not know where to find the numbers.
There was nothing confusing in today’s class. It all made sense and was presented well.
The value of the grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline needed more accuracy from the slide in class to the slide for the in class activity.
nothing
The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today’s class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well.
The most confusing part of today’s class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
I really enjoyed today’s class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number.
I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
Nothing was confusing today.
I’m sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
when assignment 13 is due
I didn’t find anything confusing in today’s class.
I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.
I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward.
I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.
More information on assignment 13
I thought the mix up between the bright space calculation and the in class presentation calculation for the in class assignment was confusing.
I just thought it was confusing when the file was corrupted for the in class activity.
I was very confused about the midterm grades and our exam grades but it all makes sense now!
The in class activity was confusing as to what we were supposed to calculate.
nothing
I’m still confused on the environmental portion of A13.
I was confused at why my midterm grade was so low
I thought the class was straightforward and there was nothing really confusing about it
My midterm grade was wrong but Jeff corrected it.
Today’s class was good.
The A13 environmental impact was somewhat confusing.
the differences in grams of CO2 per gallon of gas
The in class activity had wrong numbers.
At first it was a little confusing to calculate the grams per mile of CO2.
Nothing i’m doing pretty well
The most confusing part today was the difference of the slide on zoom and the slide in the brightspace
nothing was confusing but i went through the stages of grief in like 5 seconds when i saw my exam score
Nothing was confusing. The assignment was a little hard but we got help and will continue to get help if needed.
The formula to calculate co2 per gallon was confusing
I did not find anything confusing about today’s class. The only thing that was slightly confusing was how one person would take up multiple earths.
Where to find the midterm feedback.
The discrepancy between the slide on brightspace and the number in the PowerPoint
The in class activity
Nothing was confusing.

Nothing
What was confusing is why our carbon footprint is so large? Why can’t we do anything about it

it didnt make sense as far as what we were supposed to do regarding A17 because there was conflicting info on brightspace and our outline document. Jeff was able to clear it up at the end
I think it could have been nice to do the weighted decision matrix, and actually do ine as a in-class activity
How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
At first the homework was kind of confused, but then the professor had explained it perfectly
Nothing was confusing I did not know we would have to do the iteration for assignment 17.
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
I did not find any part of today’s class to be confusing or unclear.
I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer!
I thought it was straightforward and I was not confused.
Do we need to make the prototype or can we draw a picture of it.
I thought that the expectations for assignment 17 should have been talked about before work time not afterwards.
The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
Nothing was too confusing this class, as it was a topic that was easily understood.
Im super confused on the project we are doing. My group and kept asking questions. I think everything else was straight forward.
You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.
I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
how to fill out the tables in assignment 17 correctly
I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete.
The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from. Since we didn’t have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
I thought that class was rather straightforward, however I had trouble finding bio imitation ideas for the project.
I was confused on how many parts of part 4 we needed to do. We thought we needed to do a-f but it turns out we only needed to do two parts.
It would have been nice to have mor information on how to generate prototypes using biomicry.
I was confused about which parts were due on Friday for the project and felt like it wasn’t very clear what our team was supposed to do and turn in.
I’m confused on if i have to cite my sources for pictures i took myself.

Trying to find what all was due in class 10b
Nothing, the explanation of idea generation was clear and informative.
I found the most confusing part to be the pros and cons list about each coffee maker as I am unsure of what they were since I don’t really drink coffee.
There was no confusing portion of the class
I did not feel confused by anything from today.
It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
I didn’t find anything confusing in today’s class.
when assignments are due
I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
What a french press is
The most confusing part today was which sections of the assignment were ur on Friday
There was nothing confusing today.
A17
nothing
I was confused about the need for 8 to 12 solutions
Biomimicry was a little confusing
Part 5, the iteration section
The in class activity
The feedback on A12 was confusing
Nothing was confusing
A17 is confusing in that we need to submit a concept based on feedback to A16 but that hasn’t been graded yet so my group doesn’t know how to do an assignment before the information required has been provided.
The iteration section was confusing. I did not know how to do it
Everything made sense to me today! I understood how to weigh out options by listing out pros and cons!
ntohing was confusing","There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding what deliverables are due when, along with some of the instructions for assignments and activities.

when assignment 18 was supposed to be due
Nothing
Constraints versus metrics
it was somewhat unclear on what we had to do for the in class activity
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
It was confusing that we only needed to start the decision matrix and not complete it because it was never explained how much we had to do.
It was confusing how we had to submit a module from a day where there wasn’t class
I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today’s class
The most confusing part of today’s class was distinguishing between the criteria section and the metrics section for the weighted decision matrix.
Everything sounded good.
I feel that the WDM that we worked on in class was relatively straightforward and there were no huge problems or confusions that arose.
I got a little backtracked on the in class activity, because I forgot that we didn’t have to do the whole thing, so I got confused. But I eventually caught up and all was well.
The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
It would have been useful to go over the decision matrix instruction before the in class activity
The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
Finding metrics for criteria that is not numerical data is still confusing
I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA’s came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
Everything is clear in today’s class, I enjoyed it
Nothing! It all made sense!
I wasn’t completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn’t completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn’t feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.
I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
I was confused as to what we had to actually test for our prototypes as its not feasible to actually test them physically.
I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details in today’s class.
how to describe the scores for the criteria
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity. I was able to figure it out after talking to my team!
Nothing was confusing.
Everything was good!
Do we need in text citations on all idea generations? even if we used our personal experiences?
Filling out decision matrix for the in class activity without really knowing what the WDM is was confusing.
N/A
I had problems finding sources for cost of production
I was confused how to do the iteration
Nothing was confusing.
I was confused about the other parts of the in class assignment with the bottom charts
The most confusing part today was the explaination of criteria with two metrics
Weighted decision matrix was a little confusing and complicated
How to make the metrics table before we learned it
The goals of the class were confusing
how to determine the specific numbers for the metric
Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three.
I don’t think anything presented in class was confusing. I just think the assignments are confusing.
Everything is pretty clear
I didn’t find anything confusing in today’s class.
Nothing was really confusing to me today.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,8,,"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
Sending us into the breakout rooms to solve the pressure head question without explaining how to solve it was kind of frustrating
This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went over formulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
the power equation and its variables
The in class assignment was confusing just because I wasn’t sure which variables went with which number.
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out!
I was confused on the details of what is due at 5A
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I would have liked more details on the specifics of the 5B assignment, but it was understandable that we could not get anymore because it would have given us/me answers and too much help.
When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models.
I am confused on exactly what calculations need to be made for the A10 assignment. I do not know how to get certain numbers out of the data we were given.
I need more info on the laminar approach and how to derive the mathematical equations from the tables. How to make a mathematical models would be something I’d like to see more of.
I was a little confused on the assignment but i think after a little bit of help from the TA i was able to get my questions answered.
I was confused about how to make the graph for the laminar approach. There was not a lot of info given on how to make the regression during class.
I think that the whole Taum Sauk project is a little confusing however I think it is just because I need more time to look at it outside of class time
I don’t think I had any questions or felt confused during today’s class.
this time the class was better than the previous we understand all the instruction but for the in class activities it was quite confusing for me
I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn’t know where to find the lengths
I was a little confused on what exactly the model thing was, but I figured it out after.
There was nothing that was confusing in class.
I thought that today’s class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There could have possibly been a little more explanation before the in class assignment.
The calculations for pressure head were confusing.
I don’t really understand what we are supposed to do for A10 in regards to the models. Also, I am not sure how we find flowrates.
I was only a little confused about the changes in due dates for some of the assignments, but it was cleared up by the table of due dates.
The exact requirements for assignment 10.
A few of the questions in the assignment are confusing. Having a brief run through of the assignment during class would help clear things up.
whether it be as a picture of a drawn diagram or a word doc.
I found the participation assignment to be a little confusing today. It felt like it was kinda pushed onto us. That may have been just me thought. Otherwise, the class was confusing and seemed to be very helpful.
I found that modeling the reservoir with shapes was slightly confusing as I was unsure of what numbers to use and how to do it mathematically.
I was really confused on what we needed to do on the in class assignment. We tried figuring it out as a group but were a little stuck. We somewhat figured out and turned it in. Other than that everything seemed ok.
The description of how to calculate the the volume of the reservoir was went over too quickly for me.
It was confusing to realize the instruction on how we were supposed to approach the laminar approach, and we didn’t know what to do until the TA came in the breakout room. You should make it clearer to use google earth or to not use the excel regressions for this approach.
I found nothing confusing today.
The assignments that are presented in class arent very clear so we always have to end up asking for help from a TA during our studio time
I was confused on how to do the in class activity
I think everything is pretty clear. I like the reminding of the deadline of our homework. Though we may need a little bit more about the mathematical model.
I thought that the diagram was somewhat confusing today in class. I knew how to draw the diagram but from then on it seemed like everything melded together.
I felt like the equation for power was hard to understand without an example of a situation in which the equation is required.
Since most of class was team cooperation on A010 we were not really confused.
We were a little confused on which parts of the reservoir tech brief were due when, as well as which parts we were supposed to be working on in our breakout rooms.
I believe that everything in class was discussed in good detail. Although I believe that going over the module a little more could’ve been a could idea.
The instructions for the assignment 10 was very confusing on how we are supposed to create our models.
I was a little confused about the instructions for assignment 10. In the breakout session we had a TA help us and that cleared things up quite a bit.
It wasn’t clear what was expected of us when we were supposed to draw the simplified model.
The participation activity was kind of confusing because I wasn’t sure what values I needed to find Ph.
Finding the pressure equation was confusing, as I did not really understand exactly what we were supposed to be finding.
Didn't really have much to be confused about
what we are supposed to do for the two different sketch models
The kind of things we will be doing on the assignments. I looked for what is specifically due to A10 and A12, even though the interior of the assignment of A10 mentions A12.
I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10. The work necessary for assignment 10 is not very clear.
Nothing much. Today was mostly working in our groups and the TAs who went around asked if we had any questions
How to use laminar approach to create mathematical models in excel
I was initially confused as to what we were supposed to do for the in class activity but eventually my team and I figured it out.
The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it
The class wasn’t very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn’t bad at all
The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram. I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
The most confusing part of today’s class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would’ve liked to ask
I was confused on the first equation that we had to try and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations
I think we should’ve talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing.
I’m confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume
Nothing
How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models
Nothing was confusing
mathematical models
I didn’t really know what we were supposed to be working on
The in class assignment was confusing in what the task was and how to complete it.","There are many students who are having difficulty knowing what is needed or required for the assignment deliverables.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,6,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"The data was pretty well explained in today’s class.
Using excel is still very confusing.
what to do for the skittle assignment. we had a lot of extra time and were confused if we had other tasks to do
I found z-scores and talking about standard deviation and area under the curve confusing. I’m not sure what it all represents and how to use those numbers to interpret data
I would have liked more details on what data is used for which problems on Assignment 8. I was also confused with how to submit the in class assignment.
Nothing has the chance to be confusing because every class is simply a rehash of the modules, with no new content. It is simply tedious.
I believe in today’s lecture they probably could’ve been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away.
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first
I was confused on in assignment eight with some of the questions concerning the missing data. I was wondering if you were looking for the dates and sometimes I have a hard time working excel.
To be honest, the whole lecture was kind of hard to follow and mostly seemed to be reiterating the material from the modules.
For the most part this class period was straightforward and not confusing. More details regarding the assignment would have been helpful.
I was a little bit confused on what our in class activity was today, and wasn’t sure if all we had to turn in was the form we filled out. But I figured it out!
I found today’s class not confusing
The instructions for the skittle counting activity were confusing because the data we were supposed to use was found on a different place than all the rest of the data and instructions for the activity.
I was confused on what what our in class participation was for 3b. I wasn’t sure if we needed to submit anything or not.
I did not find anything in class today to be confusing, I thought everything was explained well and in detail.
I didn’t quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers
I understood everything in class today and enjoyed the time you gave us with our teams. The only thing i would say could be improved was there was some confusion over where the files were for the in class quiz 1.
The first breakout room when we counted skittles for 15 minutes. I didnt know what we were doing and needed more direction.
Predicting probability with z scores is very confusing even after watching the videos and lectures. I feel like it could use some more explaining so that we can better understand.
I thought it was confusing when we are sent to break out rooms for long periods of time.
how the z scores work and are properly utilized
Nothing was really confusing in today’s class I understood what was being taught and what we had to do.
The details today were pretty clear. We were given clear instructions on what to do for the breakout rooms and due dates.
I had trouble figuring out where to go in order to find the skittles to count to upload to the class data. If it could made more clearly in the future about where that was, that would be good.
I was very confused when we went to our breakout rooms to insert the data for out bag of skittles. While the task was very easy, we didn’t know where to find the right bag and where to submit it. We ended up firing out there they were in separate sections of bright space.
The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done
How to format my excel to get better grades on assignments
Which data we were supposed to count for and how to input the data
Maybe give us a better idea of what to do when we are put in the breakout rooms because my group was a little confused during the first session because we had a lot of time to do a small amount of work.
The class 3B participation assignment was somewhat confusing as we were only supposed to have one person per team do it. And I'd like more explanation for histograms if
I think I need to get better at understanding the formula with Z and understanding standard deviations.
The only thing that was confusing at first was trying to figure out where to locate the data needed for the skittle assignment.
Todays class went well. Spending more time going over the probably and how to do in on a calculator instead of using the z-score table would have been helpful and clarified the topic more.
I thought everything today was pretty straightforward. One thing that was was a little confused on were the instructions for the in class activity. I do not think there was anything to turn in for participation points however the instructions were unclear on that.
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class
Nothing was very confusing in today’s class
We didn’t discuss too much about assignment A05 I would have liked to have more information.
Not much was confusing. I understood the presentation on histograms and z-score, and it’s starting to make sense.
Nothing
This class was mostly working in breakout groups and the explanation of z-scores was good
I was personally confused by the concept of standard deviations in terms of the equations used to obtain it.
I was a little confused for assignment A08. I wasn’t sure if we were taking sample statistics for the total amount of skittles in the bag or just yellow skittles.
I am still a bit unsure on what we are suppose to submit for class 3B activity.
The class made sense for the most part, but it was allitle confusing when you went over the z-tables, especually the part with calculus
Nothing was especially confusing, just maybe exactly what we needed to complete in class as well as where the quiz is located in brightspace.
nothing
Sometimes when you put us into our breakout groups your instructions are a little unclear, so it would help to clarify more or put instructions in the chat.
It would have been nice to have more instruction about the in class activity, since a lot of people were confused about what we needed to do and what we needed to turn in.
I was not confused by anything in today’s class. I would have liked some specifications of the general content of the quiz, though.
I found that the statistical analysis that used z was kind of confusing as it was my first time doing statistics.
Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came.
The z-score is still a bit confusing. I don't understand what exactly getting the score accomplishes for my data.
I was confused on what data to look at for the skittles part
I am still confused about how to create and use histograms and the shortcuts for using excel. The normal distribution questions are also confusing.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing was confusing today in class. I think I’m getting a handle on histograms and probability was fairly easy as well.
z-score and how to use it
I wasn’t sure exactly what we were supposed to be working on for the second time in the breakout room.
I didn’t find anything discussed in today’s class to be confusing. The class was developed and demonstrated in a helpful fashion and helped me obtain a better understanding of the importance of the z chart and histograms.
I didn’t really understand the z formulas that well because class went by too quickly.
The in class activity we didn’t know what to submit. We put our group data in but what are we supposed to submit on brightspace. Things like this should be explained better in class
I did not understand what the in class participation was, or what we needed to to for the skittle assignment. Finding specifically what my assignments are is challenging.
nothing was confusing in this class because I have learned it before.
I feel that the standard deviation is confusing and could use another day. The concept is hard to grasp for me.
How to complete assignment 5
The due dates I still find the most confusing. Additionally, the z scores were a tad confusing even though I learned them in hs. More explanation on them besides the video would be helpful.
It said that there was a participation assignment but nobody knew what that was.
Understanding when it is accurate to use Z scores was confusing. This is because I was not sure how accurate a graph would fit the trend of a standard Z score graph.
The most confusing thing today was what we were supposed to turn in after the first breakout room session. We asked for help, and figured it out.
I was not sure if I should submit anything into the class 3b participation because you said only one person in our team has to submit.
The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good!
I think that the assignment A08 needed more details. I was confused about what we are supposed to be getting done.
The whole z-score topic is a little confusing with the calculations and symbols used for calculation just because I haven’t really seen it before
I am kind of confused about the a05 assignment that the professor did not mention in class","It seems that students had some confusion about the deliverables, and what was to be submitted both for activities and assignments. In addition, there were some issues with the Skittles activity.

Alex,ENGR131_S014,17,,"The class wasn’t confusing today. The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.
nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B’s quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn’t sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that’s not true.
The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
All good
The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers.
Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
Nothing is confusing today
The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification.
problem scoping
Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
Nothing was confusing
I wasn’t quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can’t
The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn’t make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
how much we need to do for problem scoping
It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class.
What specifically needed done for A16
There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing seemed confusing in today’s class.
what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent
I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping.
I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn’t in the same place as it was for other people.
What a stakeholder is I am confused about
Nothing was confusing.
I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.
What parts of the assignment to complete
I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it.
Nothing
The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
There wasn’t any confusing information given in this class
How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?
I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
I felt that most things in today’s class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester.
Everything is pretty clear
I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
The open endedness of A16 was confusing
what assignment 16 is and where to get our information

Alex,ENGR131_S014,9,,"How to use regression lines for excel
The class was a good class. There wasn’t anything particularly interesting but at the same time there wasn’t anything boring. I enjoyed the amount of time we were given to work with our groups near the end.
I like water? I’m going to say that I like water because this project is about a dam and water genuinely is cool. Also renewable energy? Cool.
linear regression
I found it interesting how we can use the r and r squared along with a trend like to see just how accurate we are.
The most interesting part of class was learning how to use excel charts to figure out the mathematical model (linear regression) between variables.
I found it interesting that I could numerically model the data I have
I found the scatter plots to be the most interesting thing.
I thought the in class activity with the trend line was easy to understand and interesting
The graphs, we went over how to insert the linear regression lines.
Group discussion! I have finished a lot of progress during the breakout room for the team project.
I liked revisiting how a linear regression in least squares method is calculated and evaluated.
What I found most interesting is the different equations used to determine whether a trend line matches the data well or not
I liked all the time we got to work on our assignments in the breakout rooms. It helps a lot when we can talk to our team and get answers on stuff we are confused about.
The ability to compare the accuracy of different methods for the volume of the reservoir was interesting.
I found interesting how to work stuff on excel. It was really helpful. I also found it interesting how to equations work.
Regression was new thing for me, but was pretty simple.
I found it interesting how excel is able to graph two regressions within the same scatter plot.
I liked getting to work with the trendlines in A11, i enjoy the time in breakout rooms where i can work on my assignment
I enjoyed learning how to make the linear regression on Mac books. I also appreciated the help I got from the PTs.
Knowing how to use and model equations with the laminar approach was helpful with understanding our data.
I thought the game where you guessed the r-value most interesting.
I found it interesting how you can simply just make a scatter plot on excel out of your data and it will create an equation for the line of best fit for you.
I found that the r^2 values were interesting as they provided insight of how to see if a trend-line was accurate or not
I found the different uses for regression data to be the most interesting part of today’s class.
I found the fact that we can use excel to find regression lines interesting and helpful. This keeps me from having to do a lot of equations and calculus to figure it out.
How found it interesting how we spent most of class in breakout sessions and working on assignments.
I really liked how you can find r squared values and linear regressions in excel because it can help me find relationships between variables
I liked the linear regression, it brings be back to the old days of AP statistics, but I never used excel to graph them, I used my calculator. It was philanthropy
I found the breakout rooms and talking with my group most interesting in today’s class.
That the regression lines are used for the mathematical models.
I feel like more time is needed for instructional time. More specifically, explanation on the assignments would be way more helpful.
I thought that the game Professor M played was kind of fun and interesting.
Working with my group to problem solve.
I liked the i class assignment as it was quick and i was quickly able to understand how to use excel to calculate for specific information.
Using regression lines to find correlations, plus the correlation game that we can play on our own time was interesting.
The inclass activity was good
I found the topic about regression and the different equations dealing with regression. I was very interesting to learn about excel and how to make these lines!
using mathematical models is like solving a puzzle.
It is important to know the r squared value
The linear regression tools in Excel were interesting
What was interesting was how the line of best fit worked because of the numbers involved.
The best thing about class today was the time to work in class. This is always the best because we get to use the things we discussed in class and explain it relevance in the project we’re working on.
I enjoyed thinking about how different assumptions about the shape of the reservoir led to different percent errors on the volume.
Regression Lines
This was a repeat of the before class modules, barely anything new was taught. I actually learned more from the modules.
I found creating the regression models most interesting and will help a lot for our assignments.
I found linear regression interesting. It is a very useful way of extracting meaningful data from a data set and making assumptions.
I found it was interesting to work with different models with me group
Learning about the values of r and how they relate to the accuracy of a trend line
That some people had submitted the wrong files for the assignments.
I thought the trend line was interesting because it is a very helpful tool in excel
working with my group on both the in class assignment and the A10 assignment.
I thought the process of developing a model was the most interesting.
I really enjoyed the extra focus on Apple computers and excel.
Excel cheats
Excel is so useful and can do anything so easily. It is crazy.
I found it interesting that it is so easy to do complex, helpful calculations in Excel.
How much a regression like can tell us in a graph
I found the mathematical representations to be very interesting today in class
Working on the projects we were assigned.
The linear regression was fun to learn about.
I like working in small groups because it is easier to participate.

The applications of payback periods and capital investment could have been covered more.
There wasnt anything really confusing, once you went over the economic analysis it made sense. The equation made sense and was straightforward
The most confusing part of today’s class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library. Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.
I would have liked the slides to be up at the start of class

It was not very confusing. I found the class pretty straightforward and I did not struggle to comprehend the instructions issued.
Nothing was confusing this class
The majority, if not all the information today was clear to me.
I need more details about the failure
I didn't find much to be confusing this lesson, except for within the class participation activity where we needed to mention something along the lines of ""what engineering professions/actions should be considered in the future"" and what we were supposed to mention.
I suppose this doesn’t have anything to do with today’s class, but I’m personally confused as to why we can’t use calculators on the test for 6B. If we have access to so many other resources, why couldn’t I check my work on a simple physical calculator?
The only confusing part about today’s class was figuring out exactly why the Upper Reservoir collapsed, but after some research I figured it out.
I am not sure about if we should us the line of best fit for modeling the volume at the top of the dam. the linear model diverges from the data at the top where accuracy would be most important for calculating the safety. I was considering using a nonlinear model with the Excell regression tools.
The exam procedures are kinda unclear. They were glossed over too quickly.

I did not find anything confusing in today’s class.
What we needed to turn in for the in class assignment.
I was confused about the exam style and would’ve like more information about the exam but other than that the class itself wasn’t that confusing.
Something that needed more details was the ways to calculate flow rate in the excel sheet through the two methods.
I found the lecture very clear today. Everything made sense because it was explained thoroughly and completely. I know what I am going to do to study for the exam and I am on track with my team for A12.
Nothing was really confusing besides trying to get all the reasons why the dam failed.
I was a bit confused about the exact requirements for units of the instantaneous volumetric flow rate, do we need to make sure it is in multiple units?
The one thing that was confusing about today’s class was how would you go about calculating the efficiency for the power equation?
Everything was made to be very clear and easy to understand throughout this lecture. The usage of videos and examples to help show engineering failures helped broaden my understanding and helped define engineering failures easier than just giving a standard definition.
There wasn't anything confusing today.

Nothing confusing. Good work time today.
I believe that everything said in the class period today was clear and had plenty of instructions.
For the most part, this lecture was very informative and not confusing at all. Maybe a little more information about the format of the exam would be nice.

Nothing today was confusing! It was a great lecture that was very helpful
Everything was clear today. Nothing was confusing
I still struggle with determining volumetric flow rate.
We went over a lot about examples of engineering failures, but most of these mistakes were made by teams, so how do we ensure mistakes dont happen if our team insists on cutting corners?

Alex,ENGR131_S015,19,,"Nothing was confusing in today’s class. the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don’t drink coffee. This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me.
I have no complaints!
Nothing in today’s class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don’t drink coffee, so I didn’t really have much perspective for the problem.
I think the instructions on the a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i class needs to be included in our proyect or not
how many pros and cons and geared towards what
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn’t need to do all of them it made a bit more sense.
I didn’t think anything was confusing for today’s class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently.
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out.
I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.
Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple.
I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I’m not sure on how to look for them.
How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations.
I wasn’t confused on any concept from today’s class.
We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity.
Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping.
There wasn’t much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17
The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help.
Not in today’s class but in the previous class because my team didn’t realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn’t much.
How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers
I don’t have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture.
I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17.
I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn’t have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would’ve been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information.
There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA’s helped good today too.
I was confused as to how indepth the pro’s and con’s diagram should be.
The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not.
The different steps to the final project
Something confusing in today’s class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work.
There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time.
None
I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements.
I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first.
I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17.
everything was pretty clear
I didn’t find anything that was too confusing in today’s class.
The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them.
Nothing needs more details

Nothing today
What we are supposed to do for the iteration part
nothing
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was are the exploring prior art supposed to be just general things being done or are they supposed to relate specifically to our ideas that we generated?
Nothing was confusing in today’s class! The in-class activity made a lot of sense and really helped us when generating ideas.
It was really confusing to follow what is expected from Assignment 17, I still don’t fully understand what is expected of us.","A majority of the students seem concerned about Assignment 17, and what parts of the assignment are due when. There was some discussion about the coffee makers, as well, as a few students do not drink coffee. This topic also led to some confusion about the pro's and con's activity, as the two seem tied. Lastly, some students have some questions about idea generation and also the iteration aspect of the project.","the only thing I had a hard time with was thinking of pros and cons for the two coffee makers because I don’t drink coffee. I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completelyclear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumerserviceintroduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyector not More information about the iteration section would be helpful.  I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss theprosand cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french pressworked,but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it wasjustconfusing at first.   I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment.","['The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing theentire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a fewparts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment wasconfusing, however, the PT was a great help.', ' Something confusing in today’s class was the exact sections requiredfor A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so weended up being a little bit ahead on work.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,20,,"The thing that was the most interesting was working with my peers to generate ideas and solutions
Design process
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future
Even a detailed sketch can be a prototype.
Ways we found that might work to develop our prototype
I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting.
I found the group time very helpful for assignment 18
it was exciting that i can make something
Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has.
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes.
I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping.
Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff’s costume.
The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting
Something I found most interesting in today’s class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping.
What was due for assignment 17
The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes
I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment.
The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype.
The ways that we will evaluate each prototype.
I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with my group about how to do prototypes.

The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype.
Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines
I like the idea of doing prototypes in general, especially how creative you can get while making/testing them.
I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap.
I’m enjoying this project as a whole and I’m looking forward to building and testing our prototypes.
What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative.
The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting.
I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on.
I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model
That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
We didn’t do much just got some work done.
Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success.
I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something.
expanding my knowledge on prototypes
designing our prototypes
We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
I found working with my team interesting.
Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out
I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone.
Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype
The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,7,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I found the informatjon about the Taum Sauk Reservoir most interesting. I think this will be a very enjoyable project, as the topic is very intriguing.
Learning about the reservoir and the Sauk project.
What I found interesting about today’s class is the models and calculation that will be incorporated for the group project based on the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I found the complexity of the reservoir very interesting and fascinating.
In today’s class I thought that learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting.
I found the overview on how dams work to be interesting. I like learning about power and electric especially what happens behind the scenes of everyday life.
There wasn't much that was interesting in the class.
The video we watched about how hydroelectric dams work was interesting. It filled in the gaps in my knowledge I had from the in class activity.
Hydroelectric power generation was cool to get to understand.
How much data is in the Taum Sauk dataset.
the new project assigned was interesting to see our new responsibilities for this project.
The different ways to find helpful research articles and reliable sources
It was interesting to see the new project we will work on.
I think it's interesting how we are going to be using mathematical and geometric models in order to get the proper data about the dam.
I liked discussing the hydro electric power in lecture today I found it very interesting to learn about,
Information about how a hydroelectric dam works
I think the most interesting thing was how the taum sauk reservoir worked as well as the differences btw the dam and run of water hydro power
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how hydroelectric plants work, especially how they manage to store water for a later time where power is most needed.
I find hydropower very interesting and getting to explore that process more is great.
Our in-class activity was interesting because we were able to do some research that conincides with our next assignment.
The citation format, I felt, was important because in previous assignments the way to cite sources was not clear so it cleared up some confusion.
I found learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir to be the most interesting.
What I found most interesting was when reading about what needed to be completed for A10. When doing this I really loved talking with my team and learning about the background information and what I will need to do for this assignment.
In today’s class, I enjoyed researching the Taum Saul reservoir. It was interesting to learn about its importance. For example, it was the first fully autonomous power generation plant in America.
Taum sauk
hydroelectric power was very interesting to learn about. the Taum Sauk reservoir is a very interesting structure and I'm excited to learn more about it.
I really enjoyed learning more about hydroelectric dams and how they work.
Learning about hydropower was interesting and the effects and detriments to it
Citation part was also interesting. Because I can use wikipedia.
I enjoy water projects so this is a cool thing to start.
The hydroelectric Sam video was informative and interesting
I thought that the in class assignment was interesting and enjoyed doing the research on how hydroelectric generators function.
I found interesting the shape of the reservoir.
The most interesting thing about todays class was starting a new project. I’m excited for the new peoject now since we will be making models and applying it to another bigger thing. The new project with the reservoir seems very interesting to me.
I found the correct way to constructively critisize a teamate interesting because I had never done peer evaluations before.
I think that the new project we are working on is very interesting. Just from doing research on the company, I can see how they have had failures and struggles, and I think it will be cool to see how we can improve upon their mistakes.
I found it interesting when we we talked about how to better rank our team members and how to give them good feedback.
The most interesting part of today’s class was working with my teammates and sharing ideas with them.
I found the idea of the assignment interesting specifically the use of excel and math to determine safety
researching how hydropower works
Researching the Tatum Sauk reservoir and learning how to properly answer a research question.
I suppose this doesn’t relate directly to the class, but the most interesting thing I learned during this meeting was that reservoirs can be essentially used as massive batteries. I had never thought of them being used to store power to be used at a later date!
It was interesting to learn about the Taum Sauk reservoir and it’s failure in 2005.
the Taum Sauk Reservoir disaster
The new team assignment
Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting. Especially with regards to the shape. I think it will be a fun task finding the volume.
I found the team evaluation interesting today.
I found the explanation on hydroelectric power interesting.
I found the reasons for using hydroelectric power to be interesting. I learned a lot about how it is a very viable source of energy to power things.
I really enjoyed the team discussion periods of the class and found the instructions very helpful.
The mathematical models we have to do in activity 10.
I found the concept of the project interesting.
I enjoyed learning about hydroelectric power sources.
Something interesting was we are evaluate and make helpful opinion to the real world power station firm.
I found studying the reservoir very interesting. I enjoyed reading about it and hearing some of the story behind it.
The thing that I found most interesting in today’s class was just being able to research and find out how hydropower generators work.
The work we completed on proper sources.
Starting a new project is very interesting to be able to learn and apply more engineering and data analysis skills.
The building process of something so impactful as a hydroelectric dam
I found it interesting how we can manipulate our data for the upcoming assignment and learning about the Reservoir
I'm very interested in formulating the volume calculation for the reservoir by using the Laminar Approach.
I really enjoyed the breakout rooms and I wish they were longer. I’m excited to start a new project and I can’t wait to learn more about engineering through these assignments.
I found hydroelectric power very interesting in today's class
I think this whole project is very interesting, I really enjoy the concept of the dam and what has happened to it. And us analyzing the data to improve it
I found that working on assignment 10 was interesting as we were navigating a new project
all of the different resources for trustworthy information was interesting. I didnt know there were so many places
Learning about and getting an introduction to hydropower and the impact of turbines. As well as learning about the upcoming assignment about.
the upper taum samk reservoir is a failure.
It was interesting to learn about hydroelectric generators, and also how the taum sauk reservoir was the biggest natural battery that existed and also how it had failed at one point due to poor building and not stopping the pump.
The thing I found most interesting in today’s class was the video on hydroelectric power. The explanation to reinforce what we learned during the in-class activity helped me feel like I understand the groundwork for the topic.","The students seem very interested in the Tom Sauk reservoir, and learning about hydroelectric power.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,17,,"nothing
There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity.
Nothing
The executive summary part of A16
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
Nothing was confusing in today’s class
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them.
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
The confusing part of today’s class was how to address stakeholders.
I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class
I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment
The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping
Nothing was confusing or hard in today’s class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard
The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was do you account for criteria that isn’t stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
Something that could have used more details in today’s class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn’t really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given.
I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we’re supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information
Nothing
I was confused on the metrics section.
The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn’t seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution.
Not much was confusing in today’s class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing.
I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today.
I didn’t think much was confusing in today’s class, as I felt I understood the material very well.
More details about what is due for the first milestone
I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing.
Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still
I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due.
Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one.
Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret
Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time
The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bitconfusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials.
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out.
The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well.
Nothing really
In the beginning, we weren’t sure where Assignment 16 was located. However, Jeff Hall directed us to the right place!
The survey of the public seems like quite a lot of work
nothing was confusing
How to identify users and clients, since sometimes it may be challenging to figure out.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren’t on campus and also when we don’t know a large amount of people who live on or around campus.
The Google example of client and user was a little bit confusing.
Nothing
I did not quite get how we were going to gather the data for this project.
I didn’t find anything too confusing in today’s class.
I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn’t really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
In this class there wasn’t much confusing. I was confused on how much material was presented in the homework. Our group felt like sections 2 3 and 4 were just too much work and it was very overwhelming
It is a little bit confusing how does it help to keep doing the same things over and over again.
What parts of the report we are supposed and do and when. Also how to improve the transportation system at Purdue","Many students have issues with project logistics. Students feel that they can't find documents, have too much work to do in too little time, or are confused about the actual due dates because the website says one thing, but the professor said something else in class. Clearing these confusions up should be of the highest priority. Students also discussed having some trouble with parts of the project, such as problem scoping, defining criteria and constraints, empathizing with users, and incorporating stakeholders. Lastly, some students raised some concerns about quizzes, and how to study for them. "," I found the difference between problem scoping and what we havebeendoing in each of the previous assignments confusing becausethedifference isn’t really clear to me.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"Test
I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done.
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself.
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
The histogram plotting and the activity A07
I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.
I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting.
I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
Learning more about my breakout group
The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram.
The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.
I found it interesting how to use a histogram
I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
The in class activity
I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","Many students found histograms to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture.
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content.
during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing.
One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout?
I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms are found to be somewhat confusing.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help.
I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it.
Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users.
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
Nothing was really confusing about today’s class.
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups.
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples.
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.
Test
Everything made sense.
nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms.
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
Under flow and over flow
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them.
Some of the histogram stuff was fast
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources.
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments.
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
Details about which graphs to use when.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well.
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.",The major points of confusion for students had to do with the different types of data and what types of graphs to use. There is also some confusion in regards to bins and bin width. The instructor should also go over some of the assignments.  ,"The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,20,,"Today’s class was little confusing and I didn’t need any extra details.
Prototyping
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes.
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally.
Nothing was confusing in today’s class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
Something that could use more details in today’s class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn’t catch all the dates.
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes.
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
Everything made sense into today’s class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don’t have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren’t easily accessible.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making.
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test.
How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.
I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process.
I wasn’t confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
I would’ve appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes.
Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don’t always have the resources
What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do.
How in depth the experiments should be
I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype.
Nothing today
nothing was confusing
The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn’t understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room
Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
Everything was clear and easy to understand
How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
Nothing
the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear
I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details","The students have many questions regarding prototyping. Specifically, there are concerns about how to make prototypes and how to test them. Students have also mentioned their concerns when it comes to using CAD software, being somewhat unfamiliar with it. There are also some concerns about specifics when it comes to the assignment and what is required for submissions.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,7,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"It was all pretty clear, there wasn’t much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.
Everything explained was clear.
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice.
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
N/A
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment.
What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
Nothing
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
I am confused how the laminar approach works.
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this.
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources.
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
How to search for data quickly.
The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained.
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful.
I didn't find anything confusing today.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
I was confused on parts of assignment A10
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
nothing
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific.
how to use the outside resources information in the research
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","Many students are confused about Assignment 10. It would be useful to go over the details and the expectations of the Assignment. There also appears to be some issues with the activity regarding citations scholarly work.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,17,,"starting our own design project
I found the client stakeholder relations to be very interesting as well as the differences between a anovice and professional engineer.
Differences between client and end user
I liked working on problem scoping and developing ways to measure constraints and criteria
The project that was assigned to us for the final design was very interesting especially when we went into breakout rooms and discussed it
The issue of improving campus safety sounds interesting.
Learning about problem scoping and the upcoming design project
That we are creating our own ideas to a problem we are given.
I found working on the in class assignment to be most interesting.
The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project to work on with my team
The most interesting part of today’s class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project.
I did not realize that we had been slowly incorporating different aspects of design into our assignments
Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project
starting a new project was the most interesting today
It was interesting to start a new unit and continue forward w our content
The project objective is arguably better than the other class's.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to a problem.
Before today’s class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today’s class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I’d been confused on it for so long.
I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you’re doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers.
Design issues as a whole
I found the research during problem scoping interesting.
I think the idea behind the design project is interesting because it gives us important experience problem scoping as opposed to looking at specific data and saying “this needs to change”.
Using what we have done so far, in regards to previous projects, is how we are going to complete this new projects. Seeing how we incorporate all of our knowledge into this final work will be interesting
I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one.
It was interesting to start a new project and start to scope out solutions. Our team wants to come up with a realistic solution
I think it is interesting to learn about the design process and to know what to do to act as a more experienced engineer/designer.
The most interesting part of the class was thinking ideas that were creative and innovating
Something interesting in today’s class was getting to learn the new assignment and the details about it.
The starting of the new challenge will be interesting
I enjoyed learning about problem statements.
The design problem was quite interesting.
Explanation for the campus mobility project
Leaning about problem scoping and the extent to which prior research is required before starting any sort of ideas
The beginning of the project, everything seems fun
I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers. Particularly asking questions and research.
I found the designing interesting of this project interesting. I'm very excited to do this project.
Not much was interesting in this class, we were confused by stuff most of the time.
The whole project I thought was interesting.
The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we’re excited for the upcoming project.
Writing and combining 3 problem statements
writing the problem statement
It was interesting to revisit the different aspects of a problem statement. This gave more clarification on how it should be formatted.
I enjoyed discussing problem scoping and the differences between novice and expert designers. It is useful to know common mistakes so we don’t repeat them.
I think the assignment 16 is interesting because it is applicable to us on campus.
Trade off
I did not find anything particularly interesting this class
I found many of the statistics about Purdue campus and students on campus very interesting
I found the project that we are starting very interesting because safety measures can and should always be implemented no matter where you are.
The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer
There wasn’t anything very interesting today, maybe a different approach to the project explanation could help engage students.
Our teams solutions of making an app to help solve our problem","Many students are excited to start the new project. They are also enjoying and recognizing the design aspects of their work, and relating that to engineering. Several students have pointed to problem scoping and problem statements as interesting them. Others mentioned that they enjoyed talking about clients, end users, and stakeholders. Lastly, students are continuing to enjoy working in thier teams.","I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and thedifferences between novice and professional engineers.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,10,,"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing.
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.
The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved.
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
There was not very specific information abput how to choose the time intervals for part 6 of a12.
I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today’s class was confusing
For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation)
I don’t think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
Nothing was confusing in today’s class, we had a lot of productive work time!
I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn’t that confusing
I do not think anything in today’s class was particularly confusing
I found nothing confusing about today’s class
We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.

Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.
Nothing was confusing to me in class today.
There wasn’t much confusion with today’s lecture. I thought our module quiz was so much easier to comprehend than the last one and make class easy to move through
I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
The length of the time periods
I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day.
The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn’t.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?
The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough
nothing today
There was nothing particularly confusing with today’s class. The thing that needed more details was the use of the excel file to find the flow rate.
Everything was clear and well explained in today’s class
I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use
Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it’s instantaneous flow rate.
Nothing.
no confusion
I was confused as to what we should do with the linear regression line in number 6.
Nothing we just did the taum sauk assignment

I wasn’t sure exactly where to start on the assignment 12. My group was very confused when we went to studio time, and we didn’t have a pt or gta come into our breakout session to help us out.
I found nothing too confusing in today’s class. The only slightly confusing thing was doing conversions for assignment A12.
Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,6,Describe what you found most interesting in today's class?,"I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.
skittles
Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today’s class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram.
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.
Calculating z values
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments
I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
I really like the Skittles assignment.
The different data that we were using to do the skittles project
How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
The use of z-scores
Skittle activity was fun to do.
I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting.
I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring.
I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart.
I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
Skittles are weird
The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics.
Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand.
The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
using Z score chart was the most interesting
I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used.
I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
Histogram uses in excel
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning.
Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together.
The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
Remembering how to do Z-scores
Everything else was Interesting
One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability.
The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table.
I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting!
The breakout rooms were good
I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus.
I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets
The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
The function of the z-score
I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","Students seemed to really focus on the z-statistic tool from this class. They seemed to understand much of the material, and discussed histograms and probability.

in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today.
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out.
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class
Nothing was confusing in today’s class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn’t see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don’t understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis.
Nothing confusing for today
it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
There wasn’t really anything in today’s lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints
I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.
The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation’s other than to try to trip us up.
I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.
How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
Nothing in today’s class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
I think what was explained in class made sense. I’m glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from.
There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today’s lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
Today’s class was not confusing at all and I didn’t have any problems during it.
The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those.

The confusing part of today’s class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment.
There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it

I did not find anything confusing in todays class.
Nothing.
Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
I think it’s confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
This class was well informed and well taught
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
Nothing, everything was clear.

You don't have to go through the full process of creating a chart to find the trendline, you can just use the built in formulas
Again, the lesson served more as an explanation of what's going on with the exam and quiz, so I didn't find much to be interesting.
It was interesting to know how flow rate could be derived from our original graphs of flow volume throughout the day.
Something that I found interesting in today’s class was learning how the reservoir makes electricity through the power and height and volume of water
I liked how we had enough class time to really get into A12 and divide out the work. Our team now has a good foundation for completing this assignment.
The most interesting part of class was starting assignment 12.
I liked working through the problem and finding out I had a big portion of the work done already
I found A12 interesting and I am looking forward to working on it with my team. It’s interesting because we are analyzing the reservoir’s functionality for a specific day.
Nothing in today’s class was particularly interesting.
In built functions can be produced without having to make the graph itself
The most interesting thing was working with my friends on the zoom.
I enjoyed the informational bit at the start of the class about voter registration and how we can vote.
It was very helpful to have a lot of time to work on the assignment and I appreciated how Professor talked about registering to vote!
The quiz was good to help us
I did not know that one quiz would be dropped at the end of the semester
Working with my group on the Assignment 12
It was nice working with my group to create the graphs while talking about how our A10 went and how we were going to do A12.
The Excel functions we can use to find slope. I really love how we can access the slides during class now.
I found it really interesting that you can use slope to calculate the rate at which water is entering and exiting the upper reservoir. It’s cool that this is a real world application of mathematics.
I appreciated how the professor showed how to calculate the pressure on the slides.
I really think this project is one of the most interesting projects I’ve worked on in a very long time. I think understanding the data and forming our own equations is very interesting
Working with my teammates is always very interesting for me.
Calculating different types of flow rate
I thought it was interesting when we were discussing how to be able to find power through our data.
I liked the explanation of part 6 because it was very helpful in understanding how to tackle that section. Also the slide with the register to vote bit. That’s was cool
The topics for the quiz and exam.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was how so much necessary data that relates to a real world example can be found and calculated through excel.
What I found most interesting was the Q value, and how to use different measurement types to solve as well as converting between them
solving problems as a team in studio time
The most interesting part of class was learning about the pressure head calculation and how it can relate to the reservoir.
Over viewing assignments coming up and learning about how to calculate slope and intercepts using excel
I found assignment 12 partially interesting.
It was interesting to analyze the volume vs time graphs and calculate the right slope per interval
Calculating slope for the volume in relation to time was interesting because I think excel is interesting in general
I found that the explanations of pressure head and volumetric flow rate were interesting. Inclusion of the power equation was something I also felt was interesting and necessary in today’s lecture.
volumetric flow rate stuff for A12 was fun
using excel function to find y intercept
I really enjoyed the time in break out rooms.
Taum sauk i guess
It was mostly breakout rooms today so not much was talked about
I liked the longer studio time we had today.
I found it interesting about some of the information regarding the reservoir
Trendlines in excel
The exam
Learning about exam 1 was interesting
My team and I are excited to begin Assignment 12 and we really enjoy breakout rooms. Our TA, Alan, is amazing and always checks in to see if we need help.
Not much was explained this class","A majority of the students found aspects of the calculations, using formulas, and Excel functions interesting.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,14,,"I found the calculation for how to find how long it will take for the company to get their investments back to be the most interesting.
Discussion with my peers
capital investments and determining whether investment is good or bad
I actually found the capital investment formula to be very interesting in today’s class.
that it was very simple to find the payback period.
Nothing really stuck out in today's class. It was just the usual with a new formula to calculate with.
The breakout groups. Not that the large class discussion isn’t interesting I just found the time for the breakout groups helped the group figure out what we have to do
Learning the specifics of how energy expenses are economically impactful was interesting.
I doing interesting the relationship between energy purchased, consumed, and produced. This equation will definitely help my team during the project and we are able to see and understand how the factors relate.
I found it interesting that companies have a capital investment payback period for upgrades on their products.
I found the lesson on payback period and capital investment to be most interesting.
What I found most interesting about today’s class was how much work can be performed on an excel and how useful of a tool this is in terms of optimization for businesses.
That there is an explicit formula for the return of an investment.
I enjoy economic theory so just learning about it was interesting. IE Dollar cost per unit over time vs payback time.
The number of projects coming up and the amount of time for this one we are working in right now.
I found the payback time interesting and working more in groups on the project
Something I found most important in today’s class was the description on how group work should be assigned and completed. Making sure everyone is on the same page and everything has clarity was something I found necessary to explain to the class.
I found the in class activity very interesting and it helped us to understand what we need to do for Assignment 13. Also, the breakout rooms are extremely helpful and my team and I get a good amount of work finished.
The different types of energy usage
I thought our time in breakout rooms working on the assignment was the most interesting. The time in class is greatly appreciated.
Today’s most Interesting thing was learning more about how the different types of energy are use, how much they cost and how it all works.
I was interested in the example used for the in-class activity because it somewhat pertained to a job that I had previously worked.
I found it really interesting that companies are able to take into consideration the amount they’re saving per unit in order to determine the payback time
Something interesting was the in-class activity, it was fun being able to learn how to solve for a payback period because it is cool to apply it to a real life example.
I found learning how to calculate the payback period interesting because when looking at the assignment I was intimidated by the concept. After practicing how to do it I feel a lot more confident.
The equation introduced for payback was very interesting and explained well
The most interesting part of today’s class was getting to work in the assignment.
The in class activity for the payback period was interesting. Implementing the calculations into excel make everything easier.
I found the group project the most interesting in today’s class. I learned a great deal about how to calculate both the economic and environmental impacts of the project. Overall it was very interesting.
It was interesting to learn about how companies may decide whether or not to invest something and what an investment entails.
I found it most interesting when we were learning about how to calculate payback time given capital investment and savings.
Today’s class overall was mostly breakout rooms so there wasn’t much talked about other than the equations
I found it really interesting to learn how to calculate payback and how to use the equation to look at a model.
The calculation of payback period was interesting because it's nice to see a simple formula for something that can be thought of as complex
It was interesting to learn about payback periods and how to calculate them for this project
The economic analysis began to make more sense after the explanation given in class.
I found determining payback times for different scenarios very interesting.
Learning about the payback cost
I found the bearing in class participation interesting and how it could be applied to the real world/consulting
I enjoyed working with my team in studio time. We were very productive
I enjoyed learning about payback time and how to calculate it. It’s an effective measure of if a capital investment is worthwhile or will result in negligible improvements.
Calculating economical costs
Not too much. Good work day
I found it interesting the different electricity values I got for our solar panels
finding payback periods
how to calculate payback time
I found the discussion of how capital investment will apply to our assignment 13 very interesting","Students are interested in many of the economic concepts of the project.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,13,,"I feel like today’s class could’ve used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
The details for the next assignment
There wasn't anything confusing.
The process by which electricity and power is generated could have been explained a little further.
I didnt comprehend the technicalities behind the energy harnessing processes.
A13 assignment needs clarification
I was confused on what kind of reaserch would be required outside of the information given to us in the assignment document.
Requirements for A13 are very confusing. Do we need to even use natural gas data/will the library still be heated by natural gas while powered by solar panels? Should we assume that solar panels have 0 carbon emissions, or do we need to take into account the carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing process of those panels?
I was happy with today’s class. No technological issues and extremely productive. The extended time in breakout rooms was very helpful as well in getting a great head start with A013.
What calculations are needed to be made using the tables in excel.
The main confusing part about today was the in class activity. At first I thought that when we had to find a tool, it meant like an actual device that was used. Eventually, after looking online and only finding calculators and stuff I realized that a tool could be a reliable website or a reliable calculator.
I was confused about the exact way electricity was produced because I could see a common principal behind each of the processes. I will do a bit of research to figure this out on my own. I think it will be more clear once I do that.
I didn't find much to be confusing about this lesson.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was are you able to use more than 500 solar panels for the library? Or are we just solely supposed to perform calculations based on the idea that we are using 500 solar panels?
I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today’s class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.
I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn’t understand where we could get the information from.
I didn't understand exactly how to calculate energy conversion
What was confusing a little bit was determining a way to actually find rates and costs. I understand this will be found through team discussion.
Nothing was confusing today.
Part four of assignment 13 is economic and environmental analysis. I do not know what “total capital investment” is, or what a “payback period” is. In the next class could we briefly go over what these terms mean, as well as an example for how to calculate them.
What assignment A13 was about, and when solar energy is more beneficial than other forms of energy production m.
I thought a CATME survey was assigned but I didn't see it on the website
A13 has a lot of details that I feel are missing. For example, with the environmental analysis, the instructions aren’t quite clear on what the equation provided is to be used for or what information needs to be found online.
I was originally confused about what was needed for the in class participation, but then I found it in the chat!
I wasn’t very confused by anything but I wasn’t positive if we were supposed to cite the conversion website or just put the link. Besides that everything was fine and we just looked over our project.
I thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation
I did not find anything particularly confusing in todays class.
Today’s class went very smoothly there wasn’t much confusion to be had the only thing that went fast was just after asking the questions to the class
Something that was a little confusing was finding the time it would take to payback the investment of the solar panel purchases.
The confusing part is how the new assignment is set up. There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.
I thought that the discussion of energy and conversions could have used more details during class.
Thoroughly enjoyed today’s topics and structure.
Nothing was really confusing.
The only thing that confused me was the assignment that was assigned today. I did not understand some of the directions, but my team was able to clear that up.
Nothing, everything was clear
The explanation of how solar energy is used to generate power.
I would have liked some more information on the emissions of Solar Panels and the systems currently used in powering the Indianapolis Library.
nothing was confusing and it was very straightforward.
Assignment 13 was slightly confusing, as are most assignments on first glance, due to the large amount of information given.
Something that was a little confusing in today’s class was the details of the new assignment A13.
Not much was confusing this lecture, everything was coherent.
I was confused when we were asked some of the questions about electricity how you wanted us to answer.
Figuring out exactly what needed to be done for assignment 13 was confusing at first.
Everything was very clear and cohesive. I understood the new project and we worked on it effectively.
Nothing was confusing this class and I could perform well during the whole assignment.
I needed a bit more information on the assignment that is coming up. I’m still a bit confused on what it is asking us to compare and how to calculate the values.
I thought some peoples explanations of how energy is generated were inconsistent.
no
how solar power works
I didn’t find anything too confusing
There was not many things confusing, so everything was good.
I was a bit confused on what exactly needs to go into the background information for assignment 13.
Unsure how to do environmental analysis. I’m not sure where to begin.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing. Everything was pretty clear and the instructions all made sense.
There were some things in A13 that were unspecified that need to be cleared up. For example, the emissions of the various solar panels
Everything was clear and straightforward
Nothing was confusing today. everything was well explained and easy to understand.
Not confusing. New assignment
Nothing was confusing
Nothing much! We read through Assignment 13 and assigned parts to each member of the team. However, if we have questions, we’ll ask our PT.
Nothing was confusing in today’s class,
What validates a reliable conversion source. We were asked to find one. but are you looking for a .gov source specifically or just a solid conversion source in general?
One thing that was confusing was what determines if a site is credible.","The major confusion from this class dealt with Assignment 13. Some students felt that there was not enough information to conduct some of the calculations, or did not understand how to conduct them.

The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new
Everything was clear and straight forward
I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility.
I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable.
How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project
I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don’t have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc.
I think it was a little confusing how biomimicry could be used for this project. There wasn’t really any relevant example provided for how we could use it.
I did not find much confusing in class today. Most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz.
Nothing was really confusing today. Everything was well explained and easy to understand
It was difficult trying to come up with solutions that weren't already implemented by Purdue.
More information about the brainstorming process would be helpful to aid our team
There were no confusing topics today.
Figuring out which parts of the overarching design project are due when was disorienting as it was not ever explained and only obscurely mentioned once on Brightspace.
Nothing was confusing in todays class
Functional decomposition
I was interested in scoping","The amount of student responses was low compared to the other lectures. Of the responses, most students seemed to have questions regarding biomimicry, not understanding how it related to the project. There were also some questions about Assignment 17, and what parts of the project are due when. There were some concerns about brainstorming and decomposition charts, as well."," I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I didnotunderstand how it can be applied to our project.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,14,,"Nothing needed more clarification. I understood all of the material and believed it to be quite simple
I am still confused about energy production and the science behind it
nothing was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
in the solar project the savings are not constant, so more info on solving this could be helpful.
The energy division for the assignment needs better clarification because we need specific values for the usage.
Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating the capital investment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, it helped clarify some of my confusion
Everything went smoothly in today’s class. The economic aspects of our upcoming project were explained well by Professor Menekse, and I’m very satisfied with today’s lecture. I also appreciate the extended work time we got today.
I was a little bit confused initially on how to solve the in class example. I think I must’ve missed a slide on it from before but I quickly figured it out. My team and I are having a rough start to the A13 project; we are finding step 4 a little bit confusing or tedious.
I would like it if the professor let us know when our grades were put in so we could check them sooner.
My group had confusion on our assignment 12 feedback, but we got our questions answered.
One thing that was confusing today was how do you account for the potential of some months having varying total days in the month. Would you just account for the lowest amount of days, just to give the bare minimum electricity production for that month?
Specifics of the in class activity.
I think we could have covered more things in today’s time. Had a lot more time in first breakout room than was needed.
I was unsure about some of the constraints that were revealed in class about A13 as I did not see them in the technical brief or the assignment’s information page, specifically about the amount of time that the payback period must be under.
Nothing was confusing today it was very straightforward.
Nothing was confusing or needed more explaining in today’s lecture. The expectations for the group projects was made clear and how groups should approach such project questions was also explained well.
Nothing was confusing today! I understood the class activity very well and our team also clarified any confusion we had about assignment 13 with each other.
The way to do the problem in excel
There were no difficult or confusing aspects in today’s class. The in class activity was very straight forward and simple.
Today’s class was very straightforward and very little confusing, so I didn’t have a hard time doing mostly anything.
I was initially confused about how to calculate the payback period for an investment, but that was quickly cleared up.
I found it a little confusing how your equation for payback time worked, the way I calculated it was slightly different. Either way it works
Something that was confusing in today’s class was what a payback periodmeant. I wasn’t sure if it was and actually length of time, or anamount of money per time. But I figured it out.
The payback period information was explained really well, so I feel like I was not confused by anything this class. The example helped me understand the content a lot and made the in class activity easy to complete.
The equation was mostly explained but the excel portion was a little confusing
Something that was a little confusing was the unaccounted for aspects of payback period. It is confusing because I didn’t understand if there were more factors affecting the time.
The payback time formula was unclear to me at first, the example that was used later on clarified where each value goes in the formula. So it is not that confusing now
One thing that needed more details was the explanation on how to solve for how long it takes to recoup the funds from the capital investment
Finding the payback period in the context of a13 was a little confusing because the savings weren’t explicitly given like in the problem we did in class for participation.
I was confused about how to calculate total energy produced by the solar panels in class today.
Nothing was confusing today
I was at first confused how to calculate the bottom value in the payback equation.
The calculation for the solar project of payback period was confusing but we managed to figure it out and I enjoyed it.
More details about how to calculate the price of power with a 3 year payback period
I think the environmental analysis will prove to be confusing for class 8A.
I didn’t find anything too confusing in today’s class.
Everything was straightforward and easy to understand
Nothing was confusing, the economic analysis payback period explanation was helpful though.
Nothing was confusing today!
Nothing was confusing in today’s class.
Environmental analysis
Not much. Good work day
It was a little confusing on the calculations I needed
nothing
no
The explanation of the payback equation was overcomplicated and made it sound way harder than it actually was. Also would've helped to have the equation in the chat.","While many of the students didn't have any problems in today's class, there were some issues when it came to calculating certain variables. Two that were highlighted specifically was the payback period and the environmental analysis. Some students also mentioned that they had some issues with their calculations because they were missing information, so it might be worthwhile reviewing documents to check for any missing information that needs to be included. There was also some mentions of missing info for an Excel document, so it might be worthwhile to review that, as well."," Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating thecapitalinvestment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, ithelpedclarify some of my confusion Something that was confusing in today’s class was what apaybackperiodmeant.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,19,,"I found the group time and the discussion about the assignment most interesting. The clarifications made in class were helpful
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs.
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering
This whole design project really appeals to me and I’m excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn’t gone over the assignment expectations in class.
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box.
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17.
I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
There wasn't much that was that interesting, again kind of a brief lesson and then plenty of work time.
I found the thought exercises on pros and cons interesting. The ups and downs to each solution having so much variability depending on the perceived values.
The french press / Keurig assignment was intriguing and I think I learned more about coffee from it.
I found idea generation with my team interesting.
I found it interesting that engineers go through so many iterations before creating a final product.
The most interesting part of class was the use of pros and cons to identify a good solution.
This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments
I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together.
That we have a reading day next week and an assignment is being pushed back.
that there are coffee makers that are in the form of a cup.
I found that finding pro and cons to certain designs can help narrow down product weaknesses and strengths so that they may be worked on.
I thought it was an interesting and thought-provoking in class activity to come up with pros and cons of two separate designs that have essentially the same function.
I thought that discussing pros and cons and the importance of thought experiments was very valuable in today’s class.
The interesting part about todays class was sorting the ideas we created into the different categories to further examine them. This was interesting because we were able to figure out how to approach each potential solution.
I really like learning anout pro’s and con’s and why it is important to consider them. I liked this because we will use this skill throughout our entire career.
Our ideas could be as outrageous as we can make them.
The different things that can be considered pros and cons
Something interesting in today’s class was learning how to make a pros and con chart to determine the good and bad qualities of a product.
It was interesting to delve dipper into idea generation and hone in one these topics.
I liked learning about how to list the different requirements for projects and the in class activity
Coming up with a solution using biomimicry was interesting and challenging.
I thought it was interesting when we were discussing the pros and cons of certain bike rack designs.
I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution.
we got to work on project and came up with some good ideas
I found it interesting how we can analyze different products to see their pros and cons and how they perform.
It was cool to weigh pros and cons of things like the keurig and french press as an example of what we should do.
Talking about the pros and cons was interesting because we learned about coffee makers
How there's a scientific way to quantify pros and cons of two items to choose the best one.
Everything was interesting
The idea generation clarification for the assignment was incredibly useful and was definitely necessary.
Working with my team generating different ideas with different methods
)
I enjoyed researching coffee makers as I enjoy artisanal coffee.
I was mainly interested in working with my group on our assignment.
Going over each other’s ideas in depth and being able to talk them out.
It was interesting to brainstorm and come up with more ideas for the project
working with my team on our project ☺️
The application of ideas and models
The ideas that our group came up with
exploring pros and cons
What I found most interesting about today’s class was seeing some of the unique ideas that other engineers have come up with in order to improve intersection safety for pedestrians.
The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall’s input! He was extremely helpful and now we’re finished with the assignment.
I found it really interesting how a pros and cons list can help with the optimization of the design process.","While some students were confused by the pro's and con's activity, many students also found it interesting.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,11,,"I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
What I enjoyed most in this class was working on the project with my peers.
Learning about different engineering disasters and going into detail about how things went wrong was interesting
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge.
I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design or communication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures of mechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of good communication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
The most interesting part about todays class was working on Assignment 12 and making the different tables for each analysis of data that we needed to do.
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interesting because it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramifications outside of not getting a good grade.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
I found A12 to be most interesting today because I started to understand what some of the calculations were asking. I also found the engineering failures to be interesting.
Working on the in class activity was interesting because I got to research the TAUM Sauk failure.
How oversights in the engineering of structures can lead to massive failures
I liked that I was able to spend more time with my group mates so that i could work on A12.
I found the different types of failures that occurred with the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an interesting part of today’s class. It was interesting because we got to see decision failures.
I found all of the engineering failures interesting because it shows how much damage an error can cause even if it isn’t noticeable or paid attention to at first. I found it to be a kind of challenge for future engineers to not be lazy and not cut corners.
I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.
I found it interesting when we were talking about all of the engineering failures because we took a closer look at why some of the biggest mistakes in engineering history occurred.
What was interesting about today’s class was seeing just how crucial communication and attention to detail is when something so minimal can cause a huge disaster.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the different ways engineering failures can happen and how very small miscalculations can lead to a failure of the whole. These examples helped highlight the important of team communication and keeping track of what you have done and still need to do.
when rebuilding the dam, the company again refused to spend more money to add one.
The different causes of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. It reminds me that there are almost always multiple reasons for an engineering failure
Talking about the failures was interesting to me because I really enjoyed the concept of learning from our failures although it makes the future career stressful knowing that we could cause things to go wrong
Researching what happened at the Rain Sauk Reservoir
I enjoyed learned about engineering failures and their catastrophic impact on the surrounding environment and people. It highlights the importance of analyzing each situation to the fullest extent.
Nothing exceptionally interesting. Good work time.
I found it interesting that the engineers took so many unethical short cuts to build the Taum Sauk Reservoir in a cheaper way.
I liked discussing the formulas and variables that contribute to volumetric flow rate, as well as the causes of the reservoir’s failure and other engineering failures.
I really like the engineering failure discussion, I would like to have more real word examples to understand the importance of some of the things we do.
the case of the failure
I really enjoyed talki about some of the big engineering failures and some of the flaws in design that caused these failures. I also loved the video about the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I thought that the reasons for the taum Sauk failure and how they could have been prevented were really interesting.
The many famous engineering disasters and why they happened.
The many failures that the designers and operators allowed to happen compounding in the overall failure of Taum Sauk.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the amount of disasters that have occurred due to engineering errors. I enjoyed finding out about the multiple reasons for the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.
The most interesting aspect of the class was talking about each of the real world engineering failures and how they occured. This gave the class some real-world connections.
I liked the discussion about engineering failures and what other events have happened. It was interesting to break down how the Taum Sauk overflowed and ways in which it could have been prevented
I found learning about the preventability of engineering disasters quite interesting.
I enjoyed going through the examples of failures and the reasons that they failed because it gave insight on what happened during these big events.
It was interesting talking about the different examples of engineering failures and the reasons for those failures.
I found the different engineering failures interesting to learn about so that we know were to improve
The engineering failures presented by mr Menekse
I found all of the engineering failures very interesting. It was cool to see previous mistakes and how to avoid them in the future.
I found it interesting the amount of power we calculated for the amount of homes in assignment A12
Engineering failures and why they failed
Talking about catastrophic engineering failures.
I found the reasons for dam failure to be quite captivating. That was a cool part of class to investigate those failures.
It was interesting to talk about all of the engineering failures in history and the causes.
The explanation for the various engineering failures, how we need to be diligent and accountable as engineers.
The destruction of Taum Sauk was very interesting because understanding a disaster is always very intriguing and interesting to look at.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,6,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained
How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
Nothing was confusing today during class
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I wasn’t really confused today
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
Nothing, class was great as usual
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I am not sure about exactly what z value does
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
Nothing really
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail.
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate.
Nothing was confusing for me
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I’m still not sure what it determines.
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
nothing, everything was clear today
Data types
One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing.
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)

The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
What we had to do in class
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","It seems that there was considerable confusion regarding assignment details. Students spoke mainly about not understanding aspects of Assignments 8 and 5. The other main source of confusion had to do with statistics and probability, specifically the z-statistic and how to calculate it.","I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bitconfusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use  Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z numberwas used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.

Alex,ENGR131_S015,13,,"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
All the different forms to make energy
one thing that was interesting was that only 23 percent of energy production reaches consumers.
The process by which companies or buildings have to think about which process to use to generate energy and the various positive and negative consequences that come from each possibility.
I liked to read the backgroung information for the next assignment
Solar panels
I found the premise of analysing multiple affects of our task and then balancing those aspects to be enjoyable.
I like how the assignment requires our group to actually make a design decision based on our data rather than just manipulate data for the sake of manipulating data.
The new project that we were assigned today was very interesting. I’m looking forward to finishing it with my group members.
How solar panels can be used to produce energy.
The most interesting part about todays class was starting a new project. I am interested in energy use and all of that kind of stuff, so I was interested in starting this next project.
I found the production of energy from solar panels very interesting because the way energy can be produced for electricity is amazing to me.
I found it interesting how only 34% of source energy was delivered to customers as electricity, meaning we still have plenty of room for improvement when it comes to increasing efficiency.
One thing that was interesting about today’s class was how the location of a building has such a huge impact on the payback of solar energy.
Something I found most important in today’s class was the focus on units and their overall impact on calculations and results. Making sure to outline their importance prior to giving us the project helped us understand what to expect and what is being asked of us.
It was interesting to see how solar energy has become more and more cost effective over the years.
It was interesting that we can do something with the solar panel which is considered as future energy
What I found most interesting from today’s class was the amount of energy conversion units. The source I used for my in class participation showed very many conversions for specific scenarios like coal or food.
When we looked into converters.
The different types of energy that are used.
The different ways energy can be generated
I really like the idea of exploring the benefits of different energy sources. As a ChemE major it is really important to consider these.
I think this new project is really interesting because it’s very apparent what the real-world applications of such a project are and why the project is important.
I enjoyed all of the group time that was give to start the project and I also enjoyed talking with my PT about his engineering experience.
I’m excited to start working on our next assignment. It looks very interesting and I’m looking forward to writing about our findings and calculations.
I thought it was interesting when we talked about the different uses of clean energy today.
It was interesting to see all the ways in which we can convert units online.
This new assignment is also very interesting much like the last one I really enjoy the real life applications that the projects have been giving us
I found it interesting to read about the statistics of efficiency for solar panels. It was interesting because it shows the quality of that energy.
The energy section is the most engaging because it actually went through our assignments and projects.
I found the assignment we started, A13, was interesting as well as the finding a reliable conversion source.
Generating energy has always been a huge spot of interest for me so today was very enjoyable.
The new project is very interesting to me and I think I will enjoy doing my part of the project.
I thought it was interesting to see all of the tools that are online to help with energy conversions. The website I found from the US Department of Energy had a lot of resources, which I found interesting.
That electrical consumption also generates CO2 because I didn’t knew that
It was interesting to learn about how solar energy is harnessed for everyday uses.
I am interested in the basis of the new project.
i found it interesting learning about the new project and working with my team members to accomplish goals for finishing the project

The most interesting part about this class was learning about energy and how to make it and distribute it
I found the the discussion about what energy is and the whole unit conversion for it very interesting
I found the assignment on researching whether or not the library should implement a new system was interesting because while working on it we have to take economic and environmental considerations.
calculating the cost of the plan
solar power has a lot of potential to be a big piece of our power use
I found it interesting how the electricity and CO2 emission values are for the state of Indiana
I liked the discussion about energy, I always like discussions.
I found the information on solar panels and how they work very interesting.
How electricity works
I found our new project interesting as the constraints and criteria exist more than previous projects
I found it interesting that we are analyzing energy usage for the Indianapolis Library, as I would not have considered energy usage for this type of municipal building.
I really like this topic and it will be a lot of fun. The solar panel project will be really nice to learn.
Learning about the way different power is generated. Looking at the different ways and new ways
the project idea in general is very exciting and I look forward to this project.
I like electricity and solar power so I am interested in this one.

Digital Search Tries","While the students were confused by the DST and RST portion of the lecture, they also found it the most interesting. One student specifically stated that they found it interesting to learn about the differences in add and search time between the two. There was also some interest in the binary number example and learning where to place the values and nodes. The other subjects that students found interesting included information storage, abstract type tree, and runtime variations.",Decreased add and search time with a RST the way the different trees store information  Abstract type tree The variation in runtimes Learning where to place values/ nodes according to binary code ,"['DSTs vs RSTs', 'DST', 'RST', 'The different types of tries that exist', 'DST walkthrough ', 'The variation in runtimes', 'Learning where to place values/ nodes according to binary code ', 'the way the different trees store information', 'Decreased add and search time with a RST', ' Abstract type tree', 'Digital Search Tries', 'Analysis of different trees/tries ', ' Filling binary search trees based on digits', 'the example with binary numbers ']"

Nothing","The students found the rotation portion to be confusing, as well as the last bit of the example problem. Students also found the implementation and fixing of a black-red tree to be confusing. There was also some confusion about nodes, specifically about deleting and adding them. Lastly, there was some confusion about black red tracing. Going over these in the next class may help clear up some of the confusion."," I got a little confused on how the rotations function on red black. Also was confused on delete.
