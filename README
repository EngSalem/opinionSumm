This repository describes our implementation of our project "Techniques to enhance few shot abstractive summarization"

Requirements
* transformers
* pytorch
* pandas 
* swifter


Datasets
./Fewsumm/artifacts


Main scripts 

** Starting point

./src/summarization/train_eval.sh # the main shell script for training and evaluation
./sc/summarization/score_summary.py # evaluate given summary based on rouge score implementation

** detailed scripts

./src/summarization/train_encoder_decoder.py # encoder decoder training of BART model
./src/summarization/test_encoder_decoder.py # inference of encoder decoder training of BART model.

** data preparation scripts

./prepare_data # directoy that contains all data preparation scripts
./utils # helper utility functions
