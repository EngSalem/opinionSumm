B004X86A86,"I chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. I had to return it, I couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it. I was all about this bag and then when ups brought it I was not to happy, the bag is way to small the straps are to short and one of the straps was broken.so I will b e returning or give it to my daughter to play with. I like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. Its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. I would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off. The bag is A LOT smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. However it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it. I have had this purse less than a month and now ALL 3 straps BROKE!!!! Worst quality ever!!!!! Had to throw it away!! 40 $(after shipping) down the toilet!! I hate this bag! It's horrible, it's the worst bag I've ever got! It broke the first day I got it and didn't even carry it! It's definitely not the size I thought it was!",Purse looks great. The bag is cute and flashy but the size is smaller than expected overall. The stones and straps are not very durable and break or fall off easily.

However, the bag is smaller than pictured and the straps of the purse break almost immediately. The decorative stones fall off often and the quality it cheap. Overall, it is not a recommended purchase."

The straps are also too short which can lead to them breaking off entirely. Another quality issue with this bag is that the stones fall off with continued use of the purse."
B000A2FTN6,"These are my daughters preferred ballet tights. They fit well and don't squish her toes as much as some others. The convertible option is nice as she can wear flip flops to the studio with her tights. I like that they appear to be fairly durable. Bought this for my little one to use for her ballet class. She's almost 4 and this fits perfectly. Transition tights give her the ability to pull up the foot area to around the ankles so that they don't get dirty when not wearing her shoes, but fit well and stay in place when pulled over her feet and used with ballet shoes on. I purchased these tights for my 4 year old because she has a tap class immediately followed by an acro class. Tights fit well and were easy to transition to bare feet after tap. I can't comment on how they hold up, as we only had one week of dance so far. Great soft fabric, runs small a though. U should consider getting one size up to avoid having your daughter, or son if he's into ballet, have little circulation. Don't get me wrong, great product and material. my 3 year old fit into these perfectly. I love these tights, they are great for wearing sandals to dance class and then pulling them over her toes to put ballet slippers on. They are nice and soft and the pink color is pretty. Will purchase again. This is my go to tight when my daughter needs new ones. I won't buy anything else. They are super comfy and last forever! She is 7 but very slim and these will fit her for a while but the 8-12 is a better fit for longevity purposes but they only had this size left and I needed them right away.","These tights are great. They are durable and do not tear easily, they can be worn and washed without worry. The bottoms of can be pulled up easily so that sandals can be worn with them. It might be a good idea to order a size bigger because they can be a little tight in the waist. Overall, these tights are definitely recommended."

The material is soft and durable; they stand up well to both the rough nature of children, and the washing machine.  This product does tend to run slightly small, so purchasing one size up is recommended."

The best feature of the tights is that foot area can be pulled up quickly to allow bare feet and toes to be free. Check the sizing around the waist to allow a comfortable fit.
B009L0KU46,"Got a blister the first time wearing them. They did nothing for the foot pain experienced from wearing cheaper shoes. Guess I was expecting too much, but I refuse to pay the ridiculously high prices charged nowadays. I'm sure they are just as good as those costing $100 more. Nice colors! These are a MUST HAVE item...!! They are totally awesome on my feet and feel like a dream. I do a lot of power-walking and these little cuties are RAD..!! Totally light weight but real cushie..... LOVE EM 'and would DEFINITELY buy from this seller again..!! I overpronate and should have known better than to buy these shoes. They are really sharp looking and probably would work for someone with a regular feet. I wish I could have kept them as I did get lots of compliments at the gym when wearing them;) She loves the shoes! My girlfriend is picky about shoes and avoids online purchases. I asked her to find a pair of athletic shoes that look attractive. She gave me her size and I purchased them. They are lightweight and she says they cushion her feet well. She has been wearing them for long walks and tandem bike rides since she received them! I usually wear a size Women's 10. Nike shoes run small, so I usually waer an 11 in Nike. These Reeboks fit more true to size, but I still ordered a 10.5 and the fit is great! The shoe seems durable and well-made. It forms to my foot and supports my arch very well. These shoes are awsome. I have a really hard time finding running shoes due to a high arch and the need for a shoe between a neutral shoe and a stability shoe These shoes felt great right out of the box. They run true to size and the colors are great. Great shoe for a great price.","These athletic shoes are comfortable and good looking. They fit well, provide good support and can be worn every day or for long outings. The shoes are true to size and have a good selection of colors. Overall, these are a great athletic shoe for the price. They are highly recommended."

They're good looking, comfortable, and the sole feels soft and cushioned. Overall they are a nice, light-weight pair of shoes and come in a variety of stylish colors."

They are available in a variety of colors and can be worn casually anywhere. They are lightweight while still providing a lot of cushion to keep your feet feeling great. Highly recommended sneaker from Reebok"
B00AZ6WVQU,"This shirt is OK if you are layering for sure. It is THIN and runs SMALL. I usually wear a small and read the reviews and ordered a Medium. It fits tight and is NOT long like in the picture. Glad I only purchased one. I bought this tank to wear under shirts when it is colder out. I bought one in white and one in an aqua blue color. They are long enough that the color peeks out from under my tops. Looks cute. I do wish that the neck line was a bit higher cut to provide more modest coverage of my chest. The tank fit very well and was comfortbale to wear. The material was thinner than I expected, and I felt it was probably a little over priced. I've bought much higher quality tanks for $5 at a local store. The description say it long... NOT so it is average. That's why I purchased it because it said it was long. This is a basic tank.I washed it and it didn't warp but did shrink a little. Nothing to brag about. I usually get them someplace out but they no longer carry them. I thought I would give these a try. I received them fast, although I did order a brown and got a black (which I also needed a black anyway). They were a lot thinner than I like but they are okay. Every women should own one in every color. They wash well perfect under everything. Perfect alone. As I write I'm waiting on another of the same style to arrive. Just feels quality I don't know how else to explain it, but I'm sure you get it ladies!","This is a comfortable to wear tank, however, it runs small and the material feels a bit thin.  The length is actually average and not long, or tunic length as described.  Washes well, but expect a bit of shrinkage.  Overall, underwhelming and a tad overpriced for the quality of the garment received."

It is fine for layering under other clothes, but the material is thin, and the tank is priced a little high for the quality. It is really not recommended for anything but wearing under other clothes."

However, it is not a long tank top that will cover below the hips. The tank top is average length and it tends to run small sizewise. The quality is good but the material is thin making it good for layering."
B002AROW78,"My 2 year old loved this costume. He went on the Halloween parade at school and everyone said it was very creative that he has his own candy pouch as part of his costume. He also went around the neighborhood and was pretty popular with his Thomas the train look. My son is 3 and this fits him perfectly. He'll probably be able to wear it for the next two years if he'd like. It's cute too. The hat is thin, but completes the outfit. And the candy pocket is huge. Perfect! I'm so glad we bought this costume over any other Thomas costume. I ordered this for my 3 yr old for Halloween. He loved it!! The candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. I was very pleased with the way it fit and everything. I was pleasantly surprised at how cute this costume is in person. My 3 year old son LOVED being Thomas for Halloween, and the candy catcher was a great feature. It also looks like it will grow with him, so we may use it again for Halloween next year if he's still Thomas-obsessed! I ordered this costume online and it was perfect for my 20 month old son's second Halloween. It was comfortable and he loved the pocket. The size was perfect because it didn't need to be a particular fit. He loved the hat too. Every house we went to trick or treat complimented the outfit too. Received from Toynk Toys and was very disappointed when I opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric. No 3D sculpted face that I expected. I became creative and added huge googly eyes, pumpkin patch, spiders, bats, and train tracks to the outfit to make it a bit more suitable for my taste.",What an impressive Thomas the Train costume! It will fit any train loving toddler for at least a few Halloween seasons due to its roomy design. The candy pocket on the front is an adorable touch. And it's so stinkin' cute! Absolutely worth the price.

With plenty of room, this costume fits best for children 20 months to 3 years of age. It may even allow for multiple Halloween uses. The fabric is a little thin but overall, perfect quality for a Halloween costume. Kids absolutely love it!"

The costume is highly recommended."
B005ZA2W42,"The product is great .The issue is that it came broken and I only found out after I had it for a month. There is no was to call there support. Very very bad idea. Will do more research next time .I don't think I would buy it again!!!! Charges up, charges your devices. The flashlight is really bright. I had to take a star off because the charge battery doesn't hold a charge over a period of time. However don't go cheap, this product is worth the money. I bought this to test it out for charging my phone on AT section hikes. For the added weight, it was a nice-to-have item. I probably wouldn't have it on a through-hike, but it worked well and if you aren't going to have access to a power source for recharging your phone while you're out, it does the job pretty well. I left it out for 24 hours in direct sun, the lights on the side showing the progress of charging blindly blinked, but the charge gave my iPod only 1 / 10 of full battery. I tried again and placed it in the sun for 2 sunny days straight, again, after multiple annoying blinking signals, it did not charge anything. Returned. I ordered this charger to take on safari to South Africa. It is suppose to charge an iPhone and Kindles. It doesn't work with either of mine. It was a waste of money for me. I'm very disappointed. This product recharges my wife's iPhone 4 with no problem. One downside - it does not have enough juice to charge an iPad. It would benefit from some indication of the percentage charge of the battery. Also, the LED light is VERY bright.","This solar charger works well at first and charges phones well but does not adequately charge iPads or Kindles. The LED flashlight is quite bright. Performance over time is not reliable as the charge battery begins to not hold charge. A battery charge level indicator would be helpful. Overall, a decent purchase for a backup or travel."

The LED light is one of the best function of this charger as its very bright. Though will recommend this charger to charge the cell phones only as it does not have capacity to charge other devices such as Tablets.

B000V7CPJG,"I found the VuPoint scanner not acceptable and I am still waiting for a replacement. My contacts with VuPoint were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. My contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.I an NOT anxious to deal with these providers again. I recently bought this film and slide scanner to scan my grandfather's slide collection. It bleaches out the image with too much light.

You are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner. I used the VuPoint Digital Scanner to scan over 1,200 35 mm negatives and about a dozen slides and found this gadget a most user-friendly and efficient tool. I even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. I recommend the product highly. Its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you. I'd much rather buy a hp flat bed scanner that lets you see the final photo image and not just an image of the negative. It takes to much time and isn't worth the money. Product is very easy to use. Does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. Touch-up and enhance program gave me just what I needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, Company was great to work with!! While most equipment will work with more modern versions of Windows than were available when manufactured this is not true with this scanner.

Its on its way back for a refund.","overall impression of the product is negative. in some cases it works nicely, but the settings are confusing to adjust, sometimes it is not clear if they do anything at all. product is not worth the money that it costs, it better to avoid it."

B000EB7OTU,"Great Backpack! It is well made, padded straps and back. I have a Canon 20D with grip and about four smaller lenses in the bottom. I do have to keep my Canon 70-200 2.8L in the top section with a lens wrap around it. The main clasp for the bottom part isn't perfect... it's slightly bent and requires some manipulation to 'click.' The tripod's great, the cleaning kit's great. Be careful about that front clasp. It was shipped quickly though. I found that this was too small for my D90, 70-300mm and 18-105mm. While it all fit in the bottom of the backpack, there was really no room to spare for future equipment. I wanted to use the top for personal stuff, so that I did not want to put camera equipment up there. I had at least two camera bags before this one, and never found the perfect fit.What can I say... I just LOVE this backpack, is comfortable, excellent size and does not look as if you were bringing a super camera.I would buy it again and strongly recommend this model I like this bag very much, it can hold my SLR body along with 2 lens, even with one 70-300mm, although bit hard to fit in well. I would expect it little bit bigger, however current size looks perfect if carry out for causal travel. And the bag is good quality and solid. Nice backpack. I have this same model purchased from B & H. This one through Amazon is missing any sort of padding at the bottom of the bag. Basically your camera is sitting right on the ground with a thin layer in between it and any surface. Ridiculous and disappointing.","This is a sturdy, durable backpack that's functional and comfortable. There's room for an SLR- sized camera, and also room for a few personal effects, although it does lack much room for extra equipment. Will work perfectly for a casual day trip."

B000BYGGBW,"After receiving this DVD + R, I think I should order the 50 piece spindle. I did not burn too often. I believe it is enough for 2 years. I tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it. Ive always bought the Hp DVD + R 100 pk and find that they go a long way, Seldom do I find a coaster in the pack... Hwever his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from Amazon, but so far so good. Yes, HP DVD's are DVD's for the better. Better price. Better quality. I have used these over the years for many different projects and the quality is there and so is the price. I have had trouble with some other brand named DVD's, but not with HP. The box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank DVD in place was broken and DVD were off the spindle. If that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all. Vendor describes the product as being gold in color. It is not it is silver. I know that HP no longer manufactures the gold version.But was hoping this vendor had some gold version of DVD + R in it inventory. They need change the picture and description to silver instead of gold. I have had a ton a problems with these discs. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. Looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and I guess picked again. Do not recommend.","This 100 pack of DVDs contains many high quality DVDs although some DVDs may be unusable or low quality. The DVDs are not actually gold, they are silver. The pack is recommended if large quantities of DVDs are needed on a usual basis. Otherwise, a smaller pack may be more suitable."

B00BOZCSQE,"The battery is constantly malfunctioning making the camera unusable. I was on a once-in-a-lifetime trip in Malaysia in August and this happened constantly. The on / off button is also malfinctioning, besides that is very poorly designed. What good are all kinds of features when their usability is way below par!? Have only used the camera a short time but am really impressed with all the features and marvel at the detail of almost any type photo situation. The low light feature is outstanding and will be very helpful in museums and other venues where flash is not allowed. Overall I love this camera. I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BASED ON CONSUMER REPORTS REVIEW. IT HAS MET MOST OF THE REQUIERMENTS. ITS PICTURE QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THE CANNON 110 HS THAT IT IS REPLACING. I HAD TO GLUE A RISER ON THE ON / OFF BUTTON SINCE IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY THUMB of the fact that an SD card is NOT included with this camera. It is essential (you can only take 2 pix with the camera's internal memory) and it is standard practice to include one with a camera. So add c. $25 to any advertised price that you see here. Camera itself is fine. Love this camera for quality picture taking and size. Very easy to use and takes professional photos. I like to take my camera everywhere and this is the perfect size. It's a great first camera to explore with before investing in a DSLR. Sharp pictures. Impressed with the low light capability. Almost as close as my DSLR. Ample shot configuration via auto presets as well as some options. Would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. Adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. Sturdy and slips easily into pocket.","This camera produces high-quality pictures and is the perfect size, making it very easy to carry. It has an impressive low light option that can be helpful in areas where flash is not allowed as well as a variety of configurations and features.

I'd say I'm totally happy with this item and will recommend it to anyone else looking for this type. It seems that many of the buyers out there reports defective Dead On Arrival battery from various replacement purchases. This is the case with mine, as it does not hold a charge.Its going to cost me about the same just to return it to the seller.Wish there was better quality control This battery is of good quality and holds a charge quite well. Alarm companies charge an arm and a leg for a battery that costs them only this much and are of similar specs. Save yourself a bunch of money and do this replacement yourself.This name brand is a name that we are all familiar with and can trust Was not the brand as advertised. Was Genesis and not Yuasa (perhaps the same manufacturer). Lasted for 2 years in my APC UPS. The plastic case is now bulging. I just ordered another Yuasa from a different company. Let's see what arrives. We ordered this battery to replace the one that went bad in our home alarm system. It was a perfect match, works well, and arrived BEFORE the expected delivery date. The price was also a great deal! I would definitely buy from this seller again. Great value for a quality battery. Fast shipper and superb customer service. Purchased for a gate opener. Have had for only 3 weeks but so far, have met my needs and expectations. Would definitely recommend and purchase from this vendor again.","This is a good battery that is easy to install and works as a replacement for failed batteries.

B000EXUB3E,"I tried these for the first time at work, and loved them. BUT they sell them for $3.80 a bar! And even though they are totally worth it, I wanted to purchase my own box. My kids even got to try them and they really like them too! I will be ordering two boxes next time around! I love these protein bars in the vanilla flavor. They taste like Rice Krispies treats with vanilla frosting. I can't believe they are actually 'good' for you. I usually try to stay away from processed foods, but these are my guilty pleasure -- I eat them for dessert all the time. I like them MUCH better than the chocolate NuGo bars. I find these a little chewy (my jaw gets tired towards the very end), but that could just be me. I love these. I think the flavor is good. They keep me feeling fuller longer than other brands that I've had. My work has them and I loved them so much I ended up coming here to get a whole box. Very Good! We all eat these and other bars in our house for meal replacements. These are one of their favorites but they are very sweet! In comparison, there are bars that have better ingredients but this one is good! They remind me of rice krispy treats! Love the bar, love the taste, love the 170 calories... LOVE it, my husband and son love it too---we eat way too many of them but I dont feel guilty as it is a great and healthy snack on the go!! This one is my favorite of all! Nugo bars are great for breakfast, lunch or a snack. I keep them in my desk at work and my husband keeps them in his car. Eat them with a tall glass of water and they will keep you satisfied for hours. They are low-glycemic and taste great. I'm so glad I can order these from Amazon!","Can be a little pricey at $3.80 per bar, but these NuGo bars offer a low calorie, low glycemic index snack that is healthy and still taste great. Taste is reminiscent of Rice Krispie treats, especially the variety with vanilla frosting. Some stores don't carry these bars, but they are available easily online."

The bottle comes with 120 Tablets and I got to use about half of them normally the rest i had to strip the tablet layer and dump into my pre workout. I really like now products but this one was a bust literally. Go with the cheaper Walgreens brand those do not break open. Unlike the other user. I think these pills are of good quality. I often take a couple out of the container and pack them with my lunch or for work and have not had a problem with them turning into powder.Great price and good quality. Some of these tablets blow up for me as well. When i tried to use the the blown up loose tablets... severely burned my tongue... like battery acid! http: / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / B0013OVX3U / ref = cm _ cr _ rev _ prod _ img I bought this for my sister who was having... ummm... shall we say desire problems. Apparently your libido pretty much disappears on some antidepressants. This, according to her, worked like a charm and brought hers back. I would consider buying it for that purpose. Well I cant really say how they work since I got the 500Mg but order the 1000Mg so im taking 2 500 not really filling a diffrents yet I know this take time right about the end of the botle I will see a diffrents","The tablets provide a good pump when they actually decide to stay tablets. They tend to seemingly break apart in the container, just leaving powder behind. It is at a great price, at least."

One downfall of these are they they are difficult to take anywhere because the tablets are a bit loose and turn to powder making them tough to take.

B000YA8NYQ,"This is my favorite type of motion sick medicine. It doesn't make me drowsy and it works well. The chewable tablets don't taste too bad and I'd rather chew a tablet than swallow one whole anyway. Great product! Husband and I went on week long live-aboard scuba trip. I could not have had a good time without these. THANK GOD.. it was a wonderful trip, and I did not get sea-sick at all, in a full week never leaving the small yacht we dove from. Recommend! I've been taking this medicine since I was a little one and it works great! I get motion sickness so easily, but if I take one Bonine, I don't get sick! I can travel for hours in the car, ride all the looping, twisting, crazy rides at the amusement parks and not get sick! It's wonderful. This is rated the best pill for motion sickness. dramamine pills are really strong and can make you sleepy. you will also hear about ginger. the bad thing about ginger is if you really throw up its no going to be good, i mean tasting the ginger. hope this help everyone. I brought this along my 7 night cruise trip - works great even though I tend to forget taking it until I already feel the motion sickness. My cruise happened to meet some heavy showers and I felt no dizziness or sickness except the constant waving feeling:) Definitely will bring it along next time I go to cruise again or plan to ride roller coasters. Product worked the very way it was intended. We were on a cruise that had high seas and because we were unable to use the patches that go behind the ear, we used this as an alternative. It worked great, no problems.","Bonine tablets are an excellent choice for preventing motion sickness. They effectively prevent motion sickness from cars, boats, and amusement park rides. A bonus: the chewable tablets do not cause drowsiness."

The tablets are easy to take and easy to travel with and it seems to cause less drowsiness when compared to other medications of this type. It is good to always have this on hand just in case when traveling.
B000N245Y2,"This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made. My husband and I use a white noise machine in our condo, and love it. When we traveled, we never felt we slept as well without that background noise. We have tried the free Apps on our phones, but they are not as good as this. I'd like to give it a review but no power adapter with cord and so on was included. I got a plug adapter for international use, but nothing to power the unit. I have no idea how good it is and am returning it. We have a full-size analog model of the Marpac Sleep Mate sound conditioner, and have used it for years at home, but it's too bulky to pack. This model is compact, and sounds pretty much like the original. There is no repeating 'loop' of sound to drive you crazy. Don't let the 1980's packaging fool you, this is an amazing little machine. The sound is robust, and the ability to dial in the mixture of rain and water effects is outstanding.Now... when will they release an App so I can use it on my phone at the office... We've used Marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this Travel machine didn't make the grade. Sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. This was $50 +. We returned it to Amazon.","a good product, compares to the original very good, for the fraction of the size. very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm, since the space is an issue there. there was no power cord, so that should be kept in mind. much better than nose generating apps."

B0036SGFXO,"VERY EASY TO USE AND LOVED THE WAY THE CHICKEN COOKED. JUST ANOTHER GREAT WAY OF COOKING ON YOUR GRILL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO TURN IT AROUND. YOU PUT IT ON YOUR GRILL AND GO DO YOUR SIDE DISHES WHILE YOUR CHICKEN IS DONE. I had in the past bought and a chicken roaster in South Africa but I now cannot find anyone who sells them. I went on to Amazon and found this product and I have received them and am very happy with my purchase. My husband and I use this all the time to cook whole chickens now. We don't bother putting a beer can in it. I've used it several times on the grill as well as in the oven. The chicken comes out perfectly cooked and the skin nice and crispy every time! I like the pan under the chicken to catch the drippings, but it is awful tall. even using the bottom rack of my oven the chicken almost touches the broiler. no way it would fit in our bbq. it really makes great tasting chicken!! Five stars for the collapsible design. It holds a normal size beer can but not a bottle. I only use it as a stand (humidity is irrelevant for a Char-broil infrared cooker), and it is very solid. Goes right on the rack or grill without any fear of tipping, and holds a large chicken. This is a perfect substitute for doing rotisserie chicken in the winter when the Barbie won't heat up to temp. I use two of them at the same time to put two chickens in the oven at 475 degrees coated with Sams Rotisserie Rub and it turns out perfect every time... no beer can needed- the chickens stay moist on there own.","This chicken roaster works both in the oven and on the grill. It's a great way to cook a whole chicken and has a pan underneath to catch all the drippings. It can be used with a beer can or without, and holds a large chicken. It's a little tall, so it may not work in all ovens and barbecue grills."

B00442C8RS,"It worked as advertised although I didn't check to see if it make the actual 27 pounds per day. I bought it for the camper and seemed to satisfy the demand for ice. It sure beats paying $3 / bag at the camp store. It won't take long to pay for it. I thought this was exactly like my current ice maker but when it got here it wasn't. Once seeing it I wondered what size it was going to make but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the large cubes. It ended up being all it was advertised to be and I love it. I would recommend it to all. Very different from what I'm used to which is a regular freezer ice maker. It's kind of a process if you use all the time, which I do, you develop a system. Makes ice fast. Simple to operate. absolutely love it!!! this is the 2nd one we have. The 1st one lasted 8 years!!! I love having ice made all the time. I have it made by the refrigerator also but I love this machine better. Gave this as a gift to my daughter and son-in-law for their deck. The have numerous pool parties and according to my daughter, this works great. It prevents wet feet from going in the house to get ice. It fits nicely on their deck and they seem to be enjoying it. This thing works like a charm. We use it in our bar at home and in our RV when traveling. You just have to remember to empty it when not in use and keep it clean. It does the job for parties! Very fast and efficient.","This is a great ice maker that works quickly, is easy to use, and can be used in a variety of situations (camping, poolside, parties, etc).

Tortillas taste so fresh, no yucky preservatives, and you'll save TONS not buying anymore bleached white over-priced tortillas at the grocery store. It worked great for 6 months and suddenly stopped working. CucinaPro customer care was pretty useful in replacing the defective one with brand new one within a week. Thanks for a great customer service!!! Hopefully, this one won't go bad in next 6 months. The machine is very tricky. It requires some trial and errors to make it work right. I do not like to put oil in the dough; however, it appears to me that without oil it is impossible to make tortilla or chapatti. It is useless for me. Great machine!!! I use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time. I also make pizza crusts, pancakes and crepes. You have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy. Love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch. Fun and easy to use! Took me one batch to get my technique worked out, but it was very simple, easy to follow directions. Easy clean up too! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric tortilla maker! I noticed that several reviews indicated that users were using this machine to both press and cook their tortillas. This machine works in the same way as the 3000 dollar tortilla press except no automatic operation, that said a tortilla press needs to be hot to keep the tortilla from shrinking, however the tortilla needs to be finished cooking on a griddle for best results.",This is a high quality easy to use tortilla maker. This machine can make delicious tortillas every time. The technique is easy to learn and can be mastered quickly so that every batch of tortillas made is fresh and delicious. This machine is highly recommended for easily making homemade tortillas.

B000N6MI7E,"The actual magnets are + / - 1 / 4 'in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things. Did not work for my 6 keys plus a car fob.The hooks look good though. That said, I am sending them back. The magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal surface.Unfortunately, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame. My frame is an 8x11 docuement with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards. for the size of the hanger, it has a very low magnet.doesn't hold too much - not even a small kithen towel. might hold a small keychain... had to cannibalize 3 out of the 5 to make 2 hold some weight. These are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys. They have a diameter of about 3 / 4 of an inch. I wanted to put aprons on them, but they are not big enough, nor strong enough. They have a micro sized magnet on the back that is strong for its tiny appearance. I purchased the set some years ago and loved how strong the magnets used on the hooks were. I ordered more last week and discovered that the magnets are now 1 / 4 the size on the previous version. The magnets are not at all as strong, and I am very disappointed. These magnets are definitely not strong enough to be worthwhile, even for light objects. Try the ones rated for 25 lbs... even though that's probably overkill for your needs, at least you'll KNOW that they're adequate for any task.","These hooks are decent for hanging up very small things. Common household essentials such as oven mittens or kitchen towels are possible to hang up, but give a hassle with the hook sliding down. The magnets attach to the hooks are too small to handle many things, but are pretty strong for it's size."

That said, I am sending them back. The magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal surface.Unfortunately, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame.

The size of the magnets are fairly large but the magnets tend to be far too weak to actually hold anything up.

Their small size makes the magnets very weak so they won't hold items like kitchen towels or even a heavier set of car keys. The tiny magnets look good as refrigerator decorations but are not recommended to purchase for use as a strong magnet.
B00006IUVM,"I bought this one as a replacement for an old one I had. We cook with it every day and love it! It is the perfect size for our family. Although the picture shows it with a clear lid, the one I received in the mail had a white lid. I love this steamer. Everyone in my family now has one because they are so great. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up boiled-over rice from the stove! It also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free. boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) I would definately recommend this product. The only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have NO couter space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it. Sometimes I use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when I want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. I've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. The instruction book in helpful too. Thank you. This is our second B / D steamer. The first served us well for years before the plexiglass bowl cracked and finally broke. It was impossible to find a replacement in any major chain stores. Lots of rice steamers but no small in size vegetable steamers. Amazon came through again. Thanks Jeff! THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THESE STEAMERS. I USED THE FIRST ONE ALMOST DAILY FOR OVER 5 YEARS. I LOVE THE VERSITILITY OF THIS ITEM. MAKES EXCELLENT STEAMED SHRIMP, THE RICE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, VEGETABLES TASTE GREAT. JUST A USEFUL ITEM TO HAVE IN THE KITCHEN.","This Black & Decker steamer is highly recommended for steaming rice and vegetables. It comes in a traditional design that has been popular for many years. It is suitable for frequent use, has a large basket and is easy to clean."

It is versatile and can be used to steam vegetables, make rice, and cook other things, and can steam multiple items at once. It is highly recommended, and should last for years of daily use."
